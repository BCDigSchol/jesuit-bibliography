Crop failures and catastrophic weather had cast the country into an almost apocalyptic mood. People were only too ready to blame horrific events of their time on witchcraft, resulting in history's worst witch hunts between 1560–1640. It was not only poor women who were burnt at the stake - the hunts soon extended to the upper classes and men and children as well. North of the Alps, both Protestants and Catholics persecuted witches and sorcerers. Only a few voices raised criticism; and most of them came from the church itself - in Germany, the Jesuit Friedrich Spee spoke against witch hunts, and in Rome the powerful inquisitor Francesco Albizzi tried to rein in the worst excesses. Yet nothing was able to stop the frenzy until 60,000 people had been burned at the stake by the late 17th. century. The last witch was burned in Switzerland in 1782.",,,English

But the original painting of the treachery of Judas had been lost from view for over 200 years. The painting had been commissioned from Caravaggio in 1602 by the Roman nobleman, Ciricaco Mattei - a man who had previously commissioned two other paintings from the artist. Initially the painting was famous. Guidebooks of Rome from the 17th century mention it and describe it hanging in the Mattei Palace. Mattei accounts from the 18th century confirm that the Caravaggio was still in their collection. But by the early 19th century it had disappeared from view and by the 20th century descriptions and copies by other artists provided the only clue to what the Caravaggio looked like. These stated that the picture included seven half-length figures - representing Judas, three soldiers, Christ, the fleeing St John, and a man holding a lantern (in fact a self-portrait of Caravaggio himself). In 1990 the Jesuit fathers at St Ignatius, Dublin called on the National Gallery of Ireland to clean a painting that had been hanging in their residence for nearly 60 years. The restorer immediately recognised the composition - but what convinced the experts that this painting wasn't just another copy? How had it got to Ireland? And what happened over the years to cause its disappearance? This fascinating programme takes a closer look at the painting itself, reveals the details that identify the painting as a Caravaggio and unearths how and why the painting remained undiscovered for so long.","Originally broadcast as an Easter special, April 11, 2009",,English

Among the Guarayo people there are hundreds of young musicians aged 6 to 18 years who have safeguarded the ancient tradition of Baroque music, which was taught to their forefathers by the Spanish Jesuits. To this day the sounds of Bach, Händel and Vivaldi resound during celebrations and religious ceremonies. After centuries of oppression and isolation, in a country where diffidence towards the natives is difficult to eradicate, music is a form of deliverance for these young artists. The ""violins in the forest"" are a unique phenomenon in South America, and the music played by the young Guarayos awakens their people's consciousness.",,,English
