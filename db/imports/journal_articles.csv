The Christian doctrine of a triune God is open to such critique, because it has traditionally been presented in terms that are exclusive and even oppressive to some. Joseph A. Bracken, S.J. proposes a process model of the Trinity that is significant for contemporary feminist theology, because it potentially promotes human flourishing. It does this in at least two ways. First, because this model does not rely on relationships of or- igin to distinguish the divine persons, it invites the development of inclusive metaphors that embrace human diversity. Secondly, it proposes a nonhierarchical, interrelational view of the Trinity that is arguably compatible with the faith experience of persons who are subject to any sort of oppression. Further, this model illustrates the participation of human persons in the dynamic interrelation- ship shared by the divine persons.",,,,,English,REVIEW

Rahner concludes his retrospec- tive by returning to a familiar emphasis on God as the absolute future, a future which can be reached only through the medium of death. Death and eternal life constitute radical caesurae, which he can describe only in the paradoxical language of emptiness and fulfillment, darkness and light, question and answer.",,,,,English,KEEP

But the work of the latter part of his career on medieval exegesis has received less scholarly acclaim. Historians of exegesis find it apologetic and too theological, and thus unhelpful in their field, while most theologians, with a few exceptions, have seemed to find it too historical for their work. This article argues that de Lubac's Medieval Exegesis is an exercise in theology, but specifically a tradition-oriented historical theology. Drawing upon Maurice Blondel's philosophical definition of tradition, de Lubac aims to describe the ‘fourfold sense’ as a tradition, a theological mentalité, often implicit, that suffuses ancient and medieval Christian theology. It is the author' hope that the recognition of the proper genre and aim of de Lubac's magnum opus et arduum is the catalyst for further, properly theological, reflection upon its claims about scripture and tradition.",,,,,English,REVIEW

Wir haben uns schon an die Jahreszahl 2001 gewöhnt und unser Leben hat sich offensichtlich doch nicht so sehr verändert. Das Dritte Jahrtausend hat endgültig begonnen und die Aufgaben und Verpflichtungen als Christen sind die gleichen, auch wenn das neue Jahrtausend sie uns noch dringlicher erscheinen lässt. Dies gilt besonders für die missionarische Kommunikation, die nicht nur verstärkt, sondern wohl auch neu durchdacht werden muss.||Theological Remarks for a Definition Missionary Communication starts from a spiritual foundation which is outlined in Pope John Paul II's ""Novo Millennio !neunte"" as originating from faith, based on holiness, prayer, grace and a living faith community. The reason for missionary communication is not just the availability of modern means. Missionary communication rather is based on a theology which sees God as a communicating God already in the Trinity itself but also in Revelation and especially in the incarnation of Jesus Christ. This divine communication has to be continued by the Church into the here and now of every time and place. Based on Vatican II Avery Dulles sees five models of a communicating church: institutional/hierarchical, herald, sacramental, community, secular-dialogic. For the practice of missionary communication the means of evangelizing as outlined by Pope Paul VI in ""Evengalii Nuntiandi"" (40–48) arestill relevant today but have to be complemented by the challenges of new technology creating a ,new culture' as described by John Paul II in bis ,Redemptoris Missio' (No. 37c).",,,,,German,REVIEW

In the first there is a brief discussion of the emergence of Liberation Theology in Latin America in 1960s and 1970s, and its challenge to the European and North American academic theology which has dominated the Christian world. The liberation theologians adopted a different methodology, which they saw to be required by the situations of massive injustice and poverty which they found around them. Juan Luis Segundo presented his understanding of the hermeneutical circle, and showed how commitment to the humanisation of the continent leads to new interpretations of Scripture. In the second part of the essy the application of this method to Australian theology is considered. The situation of Aboriginal people is taken as an example. The effect on Aboriginal people of the coming of white settlers raises challenging questions for Christian theology and biblical interpretation.",,,,,English,REVIEW

In examining her book alongside that of Jesuit Toletus it becomes clear that both argue that sensuality is a place of metaphysical violence. The first two sections of the essay demonstrate this, and, in addition that Toletus' commentary on Aquinas is hardly accurate. This fact will help justify the claim that the Jesuit tradition includes a rather particular theory of sensuality, the origin of which is perhaps Giles of Rome. A third section shows how the Jesuit Gaston Fessard rediscovered Aquinas' own theory of sensuality through a thoroughgoing critique of Hegelian and Marxist dialectic.

An analysis of works that describe the destruction of these populations shows that the “bandeirantismo paulista” was the main factor towards their disruption. However, analysis of documents, published by Jaime Cortesão, specifically on the Guaíra region of Guairá, indicates that this problem has to be inserted into a more extensive context. In fact, the “bandeirantismo” first of all preyed on the Indians and its participation in the process of European evacuation of this region may be understood if the social relations extant in the region are taken into consideration. The social relations mentioned above deal with the manner Indians, Jesuits and Spaniards lived and how they developed their contacts with the Portuguese. Native labor, supervised by the Jesuits or by the “encomenderos”, was responsible for the permanence of the colonizers in the region. Due to the good relationship between the Paulistas and the government of Paraguay and due to the constant arrests of Indians by the “bandeirantes”, the destructuring of the social and economic internal system of the region occurred. Such destruction caused the evacuation of the European from the region.||Os núcleos de povoamento europeus, localizados na região das missões do Guairá, durante os séculos XVI e XVII, apresentam dinâmicas próprias de desenvolvimento e de desestruturação. O estudo de trabalhos, que indicam a falência desses povoamentos, mostram-nos que o bandeirantismo paulista é um dos principais fatores para a desestruturação dos mesmos. No entanto, a análise dos documentos publicados por Jaime Cortesão, que discutem especificamente a região do Guairá, indicam que essa problemática estava inserida em um contexto mais amplo. Dentro desse contexto, o bandeirantismo, em primeiro plano, desempenha o papel de preador de índios, sendo que, sua participação no processo de desocupação européia da região, só pode ser entendido se levarmos em consideração as relações sociais que ali se travaram. Essas relações implicam, inicialmente em entender como conviviam, índios, jesuítas e espanhóis; e, posteriormente, como esses desenvolveram seus contatos com os portugueses. A mão de obra indígena, disciplinada pelos jesuítas ou sob comando dos encomienderos, é responsável pela permanência dos colonizadores na região. Com os relacionamentos amistosos entre os paulistas e o governo do Paraguai, e com o constante aprisionamento dos índios pelos bandeirantes, ocorre uma desestruturação no sistema social e econômico da região, o que implica em sua desocupação por parte dos europeus.",,,,The European Occupation of the Guaíra Region in the 16th and 17th Centuries,Portuguese,REVIEW

Drawing on the insights emerging from recent research on Catholic renewal on the Continent, it shows how the seminary clergy and especially the Jesuits fostered traditional beliefs and practices associated with saints, relics, and sacramentals and exploited the potential of exorcisms and visions for didactic and proselytizing purposes. Close examination of these strategies serves to question some existing assumptions about the nature, objectives, and impact of the English Catholic mission and to illuminate the particular challenges that persecution presented to a movement determined to purge popular piety of its ‘superstitious’ accretions. It underlines the tensions between ecclesiastical direction and lay initiative which characterized a context in which Catholicism was a minority Church and highlights the frictions and divisions which these attempts to utilize supernatural power stimulated within the ranks of the Counter Reformation priesthood itself.",,,,,English,KEEP

Valignano is best known for his lasting contribution to the development of a new model of Christian expansion.

For Balthasar, this encounter occurs narratively: our stories are invited into Christ's story where we dis­ cover a personal God calling us by name. Both liturgy and the moral life mediate the Christian's entrance into this salvine narrative; however, each does so by emphasizing a different aspect of it: liturgy underscores the eschatological fullness of the narrative; the moral life invites us into Christ's story at a point ""between the times.""

The first period, corresponding to the initial thirty years (1582–1610), is characterized by a spontaneous transmission which fitted well both with the aspirations of the transmitter and the requests of the receiver. In the second phase (c. 1620–c. 1630s), the transmission became a more systematic project of translating Renaissance writings. Its success depended on whether the initiative was taken by Chinese scholars and on the audience for which these works were intended. The third phase is only an aftermath: the Jesuits made a failed attempt to have Aristotelian philosophy introduced as the basis of the Chinese educational system (1678–83).

To a certain extent, the polemical debate assumed the character of a dialogue. An example of such an exchange in the Czech Lands is provided by that between the Jesuits and the Unitas Fratrum in the last quarter of the 16th and early 17th centuries. While polemical tracts against the Brethren had appeared in Bohemia and Moravia previously, they attaned a new quality with the coming of the Jesuits. The latter brought with them to Bohemia a new mode of polemicisation based on the model of polemic theology, originally created for polemics against the Lutherans in the Empire. The first group of Bohemian Jesuits and their sympathiser (Václav Šturm, Václav Brosius, Baltasar Hostounský etc.) adapted this model to the situation in the Czech Lands. Given that the Unitas Fratrum was still an illegal church, polemic tracts against them represented no great risk for the Jesuits, while still affecting that part of society which was most resistant to the increasing re-Catholicasition. While Šturm in his texts attempts to address the broader public, the responses of the Brethren are somewhat defensive, and fortify their members and sympathisers in their faith. In this article the author considers not only the theoretical background to the polemics , but provides brief citations to characterise their style of argument.",,,,,German,REVIEW

However, early in his reign, the Kangxi Emperor studied this subject with the Jesuit missionaries in charge of the calendar. His first teacher, Ferdinand Verbiest (1623–1688) relied on textbooks based on Christoph Clavius' (1538–1612). Those who succeeded Verbiest as imperial tutors in the 1690s produced lecture notes in Manchu and Chinese. Newly discovered manuscripts show Antoine Thomas (1644–1709) wrote substantial treatises on arithmetic and algebra while teaching those subjects. In 1713, the emperor commissioned a group of scholars and officials to compile a standard survey of mathematics (Shuli jingyun, ""Essential principles of mathematics""). This work opened with the claim that mathematics had its roots in Chinese Antiquity. However, it can be shown that the Jesuits' lecture notes were the main source of the Shuli jingyun. The reconstruction of mathematics under Kangxi's patronage is thus best characterised as the imperial appropriation of Western learning.",,,,,English,KEEP

It examines the circumstances surrounding Barbaro's unsuccessful support of the centrally planned design in light of his recent return from a five-year period as consul in Constantinople. The religious and political issues informing the debate are investigated in detail, in order to amplify the motives behind the final choice of plan. The architectural dialogue between Venice and Milan, two cities seeking to build votive churches after the plague, forms one axis of the debate, but Venice characteristically looked east as well as west. The article suggests that Palladio's subtle range of allusions may have included not only the lessons of antiquity and issues of church reform, but also ideas drawn from the recent work of the great Ottoman architect Sinan. Significantly, Barbaro's dispatches from Constantinople had transmitted enthusiastic descriptions of new Ottoman buildings to the heart of the Venetian Senate.",,,,,English,REVIEW

This group differed from the scholarly community of the capital, Edo, by both training and social status. This article shows how this difference contributes to explaining some of the particularities of rangaku in its initial phase. A case in point is Shizuki Tadao's introduction of Newtonian physics and astronomy. Yet, Sugita Genpaku, a major representative of the Edo scholarly community, gave an account of the beginning of Dutch learning that attempted to minimise, or even to erase, the contribution of the Nagasaki interpreters, who were dismissed as unscholarly. This attempt, too, is best understood in the light of the difference between the two communities.",,,,,English,REVIEW

Algunos de ellos pensaron en la salida de la Orden como único modo de rehacer sus vidas, la mayoría confiando en que así podrían volver a su país. Los máximos interesados en que aumentara el número de estos secularizados eran los ministros españoles que remitieron normas muy precisas a los comisarios reales, encargados de la vigilancia y pago de la pensión a estos expulsos, con el fin de que fomentaran las deserciones y romper así la rigurosa unidad a la que se aferraban los expulsos. Nos acercamos aquí al modo en que se vivieron los primeros abandonos en el interior de la Provincia de Castilla gracias a los comentarios que el P. Manuel Luengo nos legó en su Diario. Veremos también la evolución y reacciones que tuvieron los jesuitas que permanecieron en la Orden hacia los secularizados, las peripecias que tuvieron que sufrir algunos de estos huidos y su situación a finales del siglo XVIII. Abstract: When the Spanish Jesuits were expelled from Spain, thanks to a Real Order signed by Charles III in April 1767 and, after the Pope Clement XIII refused to welcome them in his Estates, these ecclesiastics were deserted in Corsica. Some of them chose to leave the Order as the only way to mend their lives, most of them trusting that they would return to their country. The most interested party in the increment of desertions were the Spanish ministers. They sent very specific norms to the real commissaries, who had the responsibility of watching over the Jesuits and paying their pension. The intention was to promote the desertions in order to break the strong unity characteristic of the Society of Jesus. In this article we focus on how the Castilian lived the first renunciations, using as the main the Diary written by Father Manuel Luengo. We also study the evolution in the relationship between the Jesuits who preferred to stay in their Order and those who left it, the vicissitudes the secularized suffered and their situation at the end of the 18th Century.",,,,,Spanish,REVIEW

In many cases the Jesuits were less relevant in the ongoing changes occurring in literati learning. In the medical field, for example, before the nineteenth century few Qing physicians (ruyi 儒醫) took early modern European “Galenic” medicine seriously as a threat to native remedies. On the other hand, the Kangxi revival of interest in mathematics was closely tied to the introduction of Jesuit algebra (jiegen fang借根方), trigonometry (sanjiao xue 三角學), and logarithyms (duishu 對數). In the midst of the relatively “closed door” policies of the Yongzheng emperor and his successors, a large-scale effort to recover and col-late the treasures of ancient Chinese mathematics were prioritized in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century. Despite setbacks during the early eighteenth century Rites Controversy, the Jesuits in China remained important “experts” (專家) in the Astro-Calendric Bureau (欽天監) and supervisors in the Qing dynasty’s imperial workshops. Earlier Adam Schall (1592-1666) and Ferdinand Verbiest (1623-1688) had not only championed the role of mathematics in Christianizing literati elites, but they also produced instruments and weapons at the behest of both the Ming and Qing dynasties. The technical expertise of the Jesuits in the China mission during the eighteenth century also ranged from translating Western texts and maps, introducing surveying methods to producing cannon, pulley systems, sundials, telescopes, water-pumps, musical instruments, clocks, and other mechanical devices. Their European enemies accused the Jesuits of making themselves useful to local rulers for their personal advantage rather than in the name of Christianity.",English title of journal: Historical Inquiry.,,,,English,KEEP

These sermons, catechetical texts, primers, and books of devotion and polemic were written to aid the restoration of early modern Catholicism in England after twenty years of religious tumult. By considering how these texts treat devotion to Mary, it is possible to answer two questions. First, was the cult of the saints in Marian England, particularly that of the Virgin, ‘one of [t]he abiding casualties of the preceding reformations’, as Ronald Hutton has argued from the few gilds and pilgrimage centres restored during this period? Secondly, does devotion to the Virgin present any clues as to the nature of the Marian Church? Did it hark back to the Church of the 1520s? Did it embrace much evangelical belief and eschew much traditional religion, as Lucy Wooding argues in her recent monograph? Or was it akin to the Catholic Reformation in Europe? In order to answer these questions, it would be useful to begin by evaluating two texts that possessed semi-official status in the Marian Church, the use and frequent printing of which were encouraged by the likes of Cardinal Pole: Bishop Edmund Bonner of London’s catechetical work, A Profitable Doctryne, and the Wayland Primer, both printed in 1555.",,,,,English,REVIEW

Henri Le Saux, 1910-1973) was a French Benedictine who wrote a pioneering work in Hindu- Christian dialogue entitled Saccidänanda: A Christian Approach to Advaitic Experience. Therein he attempted an inclusivist integra- tion of the theologies of Advaita Vedanta and Roman Catholicism. He later rejected aspects of Saccidänanda and argued that Advaita and Christianity are too different to be integrated in this manner. In place of Saccidänanda, Abhishiktananda developed two positions at the end of the 1960s which anticipated current Roman Catholic debates over the theology of religions. One was an experiential in- clusivism which bears affinities with the pluralist position of Paul Knitter and others. The other was a ""comparativist"" position, simi- lar to the one later developed by Francis Clooney and James Fre- dericks. This paper will examine how Abhishiktananda developed these various approaches to Hindu-Christian dialogue and the tensions between them.",,,,,English,REVIEW

Even now, at the beginning of the 21st century and 20 years after his death, it is worthwhile to explore his understanding of tradition and innovation, with attention to how it related to the Catholic intellectual culture of his own time and, more importantly, how it might contribute to an understanding of the identity of Catholic educational institutions in today’s period of great transition. In recent years, faculty members and administrators at Catholic universities have been engaged in many discussions about the Catholic intellectual tradition and Catholic higher education. Most of the attention in these conversations has gone to the issue of what it means to be Catholic. The next step is to explore what it means to have a tradition. Thus, this essay examines the usefulness of one leading 20th century Catholic intellectual’s approach to tradition as it relates to Catholic education in general and to Catholic universities in particular.",,,,,English,REVIEW

The archival records of theses from his teaching of ethics when serving as an “instructor” of philosophy at the Jesuit Faculty of Philosophy in Stara Wieś, together with two of his works, Philosophy and Its Task (1877) and The Basis of Ethics and Law (1891–1900), are essential for any reconstruction of his thinking. The author divides Morawski's works on ethics into two periods. For Morawski, the real core of ethics corresponds to the following four tasks: 1) proving that there is a supreme goal, whose achievement will make man happy, and determining what such a goal might be; 2) examining the duty to strive for this goal, where this in turn entails analyzing the essence of morality and duty, and of the difference between good and evil deeds; 3) determining how to strive for that goal; 4) examining the nature and significance of the moral conscience as an internal moral law and the ultimate promoter of natural law.",,,,The ethical views of Marian Morawski S.J.,Polish,REVIEW

He joined the order of the Jesuits in 1863 in Stara Wies. He began his philosophical studies there in 1866, which he finished in Cracow in 1868. Next he studied theology there during the years 1868-1872. In 1870 he was ordained in Srem. So educated, he lectured philosophy to young Jesuits at Stara Wies College (1873–1879). It was at that time, that he prepared and published the work by the titile: Filozofia i jej zadanie [Philosophy and its task]. When, at the request of the editor Edward Podolski, the Jesuits took over the periodical ""Przeglad Lwowski"" and from 1884 began to publish it by the new title of ""Przeglad Powszechny"" (existing to this day), Morawski became its first editor and published many of his own articles in it concerning science and religion. In this way he created a new breed of theological literature, known as ""world-view literature"". As a typical example, Wieczory nad Lemanem [Evenings on Leman] (Cracow 1896) as well as the thesis Celowosc w przyrodzie. Studium przyrodniczo-filozoficzne [Finality in the nature. A natural-philosophical study] (Cracow 1887) were published multiple times and in many languages. From 1887 to 1899 Morawski was a professor at the Jagiellonian University, and during the years 1894–1895 he was the Dean of the Theology Department. He died in Cracow on the sixth of May 1901. The aim of the article is a reconstruction of Morawski's ethical views on the basis of what are scant but adequate sources. These are, among others, archival records of theses from the teaching of ethics at Starowiejskie College, as well as two publications: Filozofia ijej zadanie [Philosophy and its task] as well as Podstawy etyki i prawa [The basics of ethics and law] published in books (book 1: Cracow 1891; book 2: 1900; book 1-2:1908 as well as 1930).

Attention is given to the fact that these officials were engaged in power networks, which enabled them to defend their own interests, but not only this. By stressing the amplitude of these networks, which could even involve Church members, one can perceive how an administrative memory was being formed.

The first generation of these accounts, from the 1640s and 1650s, focused primarily on Carib Indians; where African slaves were mentioned, it was in the most denigrating terms. As the plantation system took hold and the number of forced African immigrants increased and as Caribs made their resistance to Catholic conversion clear in prolonged warfare, missionaries shifted their attention to the increasingly creolized slave population. Later missionary accounts, from the 1660s-1680s, portray African descended slaves in much more positive, if paternalistic, terms. For the missionaries, religious conformity remained the overriding evaluative measure; black slaves could be ""whitened"" through conversion to the Catholic faith.",,,,,English,REVIEW

Carlieri's sources in Pozzo are explored, and the architectural forms and compositions that form the primary subject of his pictures are subjected to a systematic 'transformational analysis' (to borrow a term from Hubert Damisch).",,,,,English,REVIEW

Lonergan formulated a cognitional theory, based upon the self-assembling dynamicinvariant structure of human knowing, that unfolds the complex relation among knowing, objective knowledge, and intending subjects (knowers). His heuristic method integrates some of the tools necessary to facilitate the learning and teaching process because it provides a key that can link the intending subject (student), the intended object (knowledge), and the mediating subject (the teacher). His differentiated structure of knowledge can be employed to investigate pedagogical questions and models that address how students can be encouraged to engage actively in their own authentic learning process.",,,,,English,REVIEW

In spite of high mortality and recurrent epidemics introduced from abroad, the Jesuits' emphasis on early and monogamous unions maintained the birth rate at the maximum level under normal conditions, generating a large enough surplus of births relative to deaths to compensate for deficits during years of crisis. The expulsion and departure of the Jesuits in 1767/68, however, set in motion a process of irreversible decline, and led to the diaspora of the missions' population.",,,,,English,KEEP

Kochanski. Polish Jesuit, Adam Kochanski SJ (1631-1700) was an unusual scholar in the Polish science of the 17th century. Kochaniski was an excellent mathematician, one of his greatest achievement in mathematics is the solution of the famous squaring of the circle. He published his mathematical works in ""Acta Eruditorium"", one of the first scientific journals in 17th century Europe. Kochanski was a professor of mathematics in Germany, Italy, Prague, Olomouc, Wroclaw and Warszawa. An interesting part Kochanski's activity is his correspondence with many scholars, mathematicans and philosophers, for example the exchange of letters with German philosopher and mathematican Gottfried W. Leibniz. Kochanski studied alchemical literature. He knew very well the writings of famous figures in alchemy. And his knowledge in this subject was very vast. He looked for alchemical books in the centres of academic life. Polish Jesuit met in Mainz German alchemist Jan J. Becher (1635-1685). Becher is the author of a few books on alchemical problems. He was interested in goldmaking, one of greatest alchemical questions. His ideas about the nature of minerals and experiments impressed Kochanski. The reason for his interest in achemical activity is connected with his personality, because Kochanski was always interested in new discoveries in every branch of science at that time, including alchemy. His easiness to make the acquaintance of scholars helped him to devolop the alchemical interests, too. During Kochanski's stay in Prague, he came into contact with Czech magnate and count Jan Marek de Clary-Aldringen, who was interested in alchemy and probably had an alchemic laboratory in Prague. Count de Clary-Aldringen was Kochanski's friend and protector until his death.",,,,,Polish,REVIEW

The second is favored by secular academic historians who consider the Church as one institution among others.

Historiographically, the period is dominated by the church of the Gesù, in Rome, interpreted as a typological paradigm characterized by austere architecture and restrained decoration. This view is called into question by the Collegio's chapel. The initial design (represented by the drawing) drew from ancient sources in order to achieve spatial complexity. The realized chapel is spatially simpler, but ornately ornamented and decorated. The chapel differs from what is considered the norm, but is the chapel an anomaly, or are traditional understandings of the Gesù invalid? On investigation, it becomes evident that patrons may have established a number of criteria for their churches, but architects had a degree of freedom in designing them. In few if any contemporary cases, however, was architectural severity a goal for Catholic churches. With the example of the Collegio's chapel, these findings take on greater significance: the patron, Carlo Borromeo (1538-1584), was one of the most important in the history of ecclesiastical architecture. The chapel's architect, Pellegrino Tibaldi (1527-1596), restored, renovated, and built numerous sacred spaces for Borromeo. What they achieved demonstrates that Catholic reformers of the latter half of the sixteenth century sought architectural magnificence for buildings dedicated to the worship of God.",,,,,English,REVIEW

An important and understudied outcome of this encounter, documented here on the Jesuit side, was the possibility of accepting religious plurality, at least within Christianity. The answers to the questions of how to deal with religious diversity in Christianity and globally, oscillated between demands for violent annihilation of the opponents and cultural relativism. The principal argument in this paper is that it was the encounter with these ""ancient"" Indian Christians that made the missionaries aware of the importance of the accommodationist method of conversion. This controversial method, employed in the Jesuit overseas missions among the ""heathens"", was therefore first thought out and tested in their mission among the St. Thomas Christians in the late sixteenth century",,,,,English,KEEP

Rather, it was in a serious examination of all historical theological resources that both recognized their diversity and partiality but also sought to find in them resources for the renewal of theology. In contrast to the situation into which the nouvelle théologie developed, the danger for theology today is not a captivity to a particular historical source, but a refusal to engage seriously with any historical material, because it is seen as irrelevant, or positively harmful, to the theological task for various reasons.

Dieser Kampf um die Orthodoxie verband sich mit rivalisierenden Konzeptionen von Herrschaftsausübung und Politikgestaltung; im Kontext der Intensivierung und Verdichtung fürstlicher Herrschaft wurden aristokratisch-ständische Vorstellungen nochmals besonders vehement artikuliert. Der bayerische Adel schloss sich dabei den Bestrebungen zahlreicher niederadliger Gruppierungen des Reichs an, die nach reichsunmittelbarem Status strebten. So waren denn auch die Anführer der Adelsfronde Angehörige von Familien, deren Status auf der Grenze zwischen Landsässigkeit und Reichsstandschaft anzusiedeln war. Schließlich waren diese Konflikte auch solche um die Herrschaft über die Sprache. Beide Parteien bedienten sich vor allem des Begriffs der Gemeinschaft, der Einheit, um sich zu legitimieren. Während für den Adel Gemeinschaft eine autonome, ständische Veranstaltung war, hieß sie für den Herzog die Ausrichtung von vereinzelten Individuen auf ihn – nach den Kategorien von Gnade und Verdienst. Im europäischen Vergleich zeigt sich, dass der Adel den Versuchen der Monarchen, das Monopol auf ""Orthodoxie"" zu formulieren, fast regelmäßig mit ""Gegenorthodoxien"" begegnete – Gewissensbeherrschung war keine ausschließliche Domäne der Staatsgewalt.",,,,,German,REVIEW

They were alleged to have slyly stolen the inheritance of a rich and pious person of independent means from Antwerp. The inheritance case and the charge of legacy hunting, an accusation that had pursued the Jesuit order for centuries, was blown up by the liberal press and public opinion and caused quite a commotion in the context of the clerico-liberal battle that was being fought in Belgium at the time. The Catholic press and politicians tried to refute the accusations against the Jesuits, but their liberal opponents seized the opportunity to vilify the Catholic party in the wake of the De Buck trial. They characterised right-wing politicians as the pawns of conservative Jesuits, who by their fraudulently acquired wealth and influence not only posed a threat to family possessions but also endangered the liberal foundations of the Belgian state. In this way the De Buck trial became a symbol of the clericoliberal conflict, and this in turn explains the entire witch hunt surrounding the case and its effect on political events at certain times.",,,,,Dutch,REVIEW

For O'Gorman, this incorporation entails the formation of euro-american culture at the start of the discovery of America. O'Gorman considers that this process constitutes a philosophical conquest, an instance of the imperialism of occidental reason that for the first time fully manifests itself in the work of Bartolomé de las Casas, who, for O'Gorman constitutes an intermediary, transitional space between Scholastic philosophy and Descartes. In this essay, I have developed the theoretical elements for thinking the incorporation of Europe into Mesoamerican culture. I consider that this second moment is a logical consequence of O'Gormans argument, not a contradiction of his premises. Given that the place of writing in colonizing processes is one of the most debated aspects of the conquest in colonial studies, here I reflect on the incorporation of writing into Mesoamerican culture. Such incorporation has a broad range of modalities among Nahuatl writers that go from a ""stenography"" of speech acts to a recording of internal voices. The ecography of Nahuatl voice would seek to theorize an approximation to the records of speech acts that no longer would reiterate the binary that opposes writing versus orality.",,,,,Spanish,REVIEW

The Ecumenical Association of Third World Theologians (EAT- WOT) was founded at Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania, in 1976 to facilitate such a dialogue. This article explores the ways in which the thought of Ignacio Ellacuría, S.J., (a Spanish philosopher and theologian who was murdered in El Salvador in 1989) and Asian liberation theology can enrich each other. After situating Ellacuría, especially his activities as rector of the Jesuit University of Central America, in the context of political and military conflicts of El Salvador, the essay expounds Ellacuria's phi- losophy of realidad histórica, his theology of the People of God as el pueblo crucificado, and his understanding of a Catholic university as a ""social force,"" and shows how these three ideas can enrich Asian liberation theology. The essay then presents Asian liberation theology in the socio-political and religious contexts of Asia and explains how it can enrich Ellacuria's thought and by extension Latin American liberation theology in three areas: theological method, through the use of non-Christian religious sources, espe- cially popular religion; theology of liberation, by attending to the efforts of non-Christian activists for justice and peace; and a new way of being church, through a triple dialogue: dialogue with the Asian people, especially their poor; dialogue with Asian cultures; and dialogue with Asian religions.",,,,,English,KEEP

El diario espiritual de San Ignacio, uno de los escritos ignacianos menos conocidos, describe un proceso de discernimiento que hizo el santo para descubrir la voluntad de Dios sobre la pobreza de la Compañía de Jesús, empleando el método qu él mismo había desarrollad en los Ejercicios Espirituales. Aunque el método es bien conocido como un sistema seguro y prático para descubrir la voluntad divina en las decisiones humanas, y usado durante siglos por miles de personas, en el Diario el proceso duró casi un año en vez de una o dos semanas,y nos da la impresión, en una primera lectura, que el intento de Ignacio fue un fracaso total. La tesis intenta descubrir qué ocurrió en el proceso, si el intento fue de veras un fracaso, y cuáles fueron las razones por las cuales San Ignacio no podía acabr el proceso del discernimiento con éxito dentro de un tiempo razonable. La investigación ha establecido que las raxones fundamentales de esta situación fueron teológicas. San Ignacio, de hecho, había recibido la confirmación adecuada al cabo de diez días después del comienzo del proceso, pero esto no le fue suficiente como confirmación adecuada por causa de un problema teológico que abrigaba el santo hacía mucho tiempo, acerca del entender bien la esencia divina y la circumincessio de las personas de la Trinidad. El estudio muestra también que fueron unas revelaciones místicas de la Santísima Trinidad las que resolvieron el problema, tanto de la búsqueda de la confirmación como de acabar el proceso. La investigación nos ha descubierto también el sentido de la experiencia mística en una elección, dándonos vislumbres auténticos de una profunda intimidad divina-humana que hace del Diario una joya singular y maravillosa entre los escritos místicos. And of Lovse, Viljem, ""Conversar para discernir y deliberar. Estudio de la Concepción Ignaciana del Discernimiento."" (2002) En la tesis, hemos estudiado la concepción ignaciana del discernimiento, con atención particular en las Epistolae et Instructiones. Partimos de presupuesto de que actualmente existe una cierta confusión en la concepción y la consiguiente aplicación práctica del discernimiento ignaciano. Al comparar en la primera y la segunda parte de nuestro estudio, los materiales ignacianos de los Ejercicios, de las Constituciones y de las Epistolae et Instructiones con la tradición anterior sobre el discernimiento, hemos podido constatar la fidelidad de Ignacio a ella y su originalidad. Así Ignacio retomó y redimensionó el discernimiento de espíritus como origen de la libertad de Orígenes y Evagrio, del que probablemente tuvo noticia a través de la obra de Casiano. Siguiéndole, Ignacio en los Ejercicios separa del bloque tradicional la discretio llamándola ""discreción"" o en las Constituciones ""discreta caridad"" y -como lo confirman las Epistolae et Instructiones y la Autobiografía- la considera como el peso de lo subjetivo de las mociones a la comunión con lo objetivo de la realidad en las circunstancias concretas (vida espiritual, gobierno y misión), mediante el amor discreto y prudente, como respuesta al amor recibido. La discreta caridad es fruto de la unción del Espíritu Santo y se revela como un proceso continuo de la búsqueda del justo medio entre los extremos. Es un modo unificado de vivir en Cristo según el Espíritu de manera apostólica, o en todo buscar y hallar o amar y servir en todo. Busca el mayor servicio a Dios y a los prójimos y el bien más universal. Su criterio objetivo es siempre Cristo pobre y humilde que viene interiorizado por la acción del Espíritu Santo en nosotros. La voluntad de Dios se conoce por medio del juicio de la razón guiada por el amor (discreta caridad) en la libertad recibida y vivida como don por medio del discernimiento de los efectos de los espíritus. En la tercera parte de nuestro estudio proponemos el uso de los términos que nos parece más apropiado en relación a la concepción ignaciana estudiada. Para la discreción de espíritus inganciana sería conveniente usar la expresión ""discernimiento de espíritus."" Para la discreción en las cosas agibles en el ámbito individual (superiores, súbditos) el término ""discreta caridad"" y, en el ámbito comunitario, el término ""deliberación común o en común."" And of Arranz Roa, Íñigo, ""La atención a pobres y menesterosos en la provincia de Castilla de la Compañía de Jesús 1550-1650"" (2004). El núcleo de esta investigación consiste en responder a dos cuestiones básicas. Primera, qué hicieron los jesuitas en pro de los más desfavorecidos durante el primer siglo de existencia de la Compañía de Jesús, particularmente en su antigua Provincia de Castilla. Segunda, si dicha actividad obedecía a un simple paternalismo cristiano moralizante al uso o si respondía a algún modelo de intervención con instrucciones concretas y con unos fines determinados. La dimensión social del apostolado de la Compañía entre 1550 y 1650 verifica la riqueza de actividades más institucionales y con mayor implantación social de cátedras, colegios y vida sacramental. Su vertiente intelectual y espiritual configurarán progresivamente una variedad de dinámicas y recursos apostólicos para la atención urgente y eficaz de los prójimos más necesitados. Los jesuitas despliegan estrategias muy plásticas e imaginativas para atender a los pobres y menesterosos de las cárceles y hospitales, a los niños y mujeres en riesgo de exclusión social; en fin para socorrer a los moribundos que reclamaban palabras de alivio y consuelo. Mirando al interior del Instituto podemos valorar en su justo medio el difícil arte de ""socorrer"" con urgencia y buscar, al mismo tiempo, la permanencia eficaz de las instituciones. Al comienzo, en solitario por medio de personajes carismáticos; después contando cada vez más con las fuerzas vivas de los lugares y con estructuras más trabadas orgánica y funcionalmente. Sin duda, la Compañía contribuyó a edificar aquella República Cristiana de España.",,,,,Spanish,REVIEW

Recognizable elements from the reconstruction such as the Solomonic order, curved buttresses, and nine-bay planning were quoted in Catholic, Protestant, and Jewish sacred buildings. The nine-bay design of a sanctuary as a substitution for the Villalpandian nine-bay composition of the Temple compound was invented independently by Giacomo Medleni in Poland, Jacob van Campen in Holland, and apparently by Christopher Wren in England. The nine-bay four-pier synagogue design originated in Poland in the 1620s and was exported to the Low Countries. It was eagerly adopted by the Portuguese Jewish elite as a recognizable icon of the Temple. The common base for the interest in the Solomonic elements in the synagogue architecture of the seventeenth century in Poland and Holland was apparently messianic mysticism.

This text rehearses the anthropological commitment of Catholic theology. The key features of the anthropology caused by the Tridentine Decree of Justification (1547) are the freedom of the will and the weakness of the will. The first of which consists in the human ability to resist any temptation in any given situation, the latter in the impossibility to resist every temptation in the long run. How do these two claims cohere? Among the hypotheses discussed in the scholastic theology to save either claim, the pretty common 16th-century distinction between physical and moral impossibility received an ingenious interpretation within Molinism. Molina held that ""moral impossibility"" is to be spelt out after the game at dice: It is as unlikely to avoid every sin as to throw a double six a thousand times in a row. Moral impossibility allows of randomizing. This line of reasoning has been pursued by Juan Perlin. As for the distinction between physical and moral certainty, he concluded that whereas physical certainty is based on the knowledge of an antecedent necessity, moral certainty is based on a proto-Humean knowledge by inference. Perlin thus fits into the larger context of the 17th-century ""emergence of probability"" (Ian Hacking). On the other hand, Perlin is an early critic of the Leibnizian style of doing theology: Libertarianism is pushed as far as to block any moral necessity of God´s having chosen the best world possible. As a result, it seems equally inappropriate for historians of medieval scholasticism as of early modern philosophy to ignore the vast continent of the theology during the age of the disputes on grace.",,,,,German,REVIEW

For quite a long time, historical studies of scientific exchange between East and West have been guided by this thesis. The challenge to this thesis comes from recent studies by Peter Galison, who argues that scientists from different research traditions can communicate rationally in a way similar to the trading exchanges between two countries, in which a local coordination can be reached even if there is a global disagreement about the corresponding word usage in two natural languages. In this paper, I try to show that the concept of trading zone communication provides an interesting and useful theoretical tool to examine how, in the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries, Chinese scientists communicated with and learned Western knowledge from Jesuit scientists by building local coordination among them. In the first section I introduce the basic ideas of Galison's trading zone theory. In the second section I study the metaphysical, ontological, and epistemological differences between Chinese science and Western science. If the linguistic relativist thesis is taken for granted, these differences are likely to lead many historical studies on Jesuit science in China to reach the relativist conclusion. The third section deals with some of the basic concepts of the trading zone theory to explain how local rational communication among Chinese and Jesuit scientists was built and developed. In the last section I argue that Galison's trading zone theory can help us understand how Chinese scientists learned new knowledge from the Jesuits, especially astronomical and mathematical knowledge, despite the global differences between these two research traditions.",,,,,English,KEEP

Apesar da restrição aos instrumentos musicais expressa nos documentos da Companhia de Jesus, referências ao uso de instrumentos em cerimônias religiosas e eventos profanos são extremamente freqüentes em relatos jesuíticos desde pouco tempo depois da sua chegada no Brasil até a expulsão dos padres em 1759. A pesquisa em documentos desse período pode levantar importantes informações sobre a prática instrumental nos estabelecimentos jesuíticos da América Portuguesa. Além de documentos jesuíticos originais dos séculos XVI a XVIII, para este trabalho foram utilizadas publicações ou transcrições modernas destes documentos, e cópias (manuscritas, xerográficas, digitalizadas ou microfilmadas) de originais. Por meio destes textos percebe-se que o uso de instrumentos nas aldeias é mencionado com freqüência, porém nos relatos sobre os colégios praticamente o único instrumento mencionado é o órgão. Isso mostra que nos estabelecimentos jesuíticos do Brasil colonial existia uma estreita relação entre a prática musical e a catequese indígena, enquanto nos colégios se mantinha a prática usual determinada pela Igreja.||In 1549 the Jesuit priest Manoel da Nóbrega arrived at the Brazilian shores, and this event marked the beginning of an intensive activity exerted by Jesuits in America. Despite de fact that musical instruments were forbidden by the rules of the Society of Jesus, references to the use of instruments in religious ceremonies and nonsacred events are very frequent in reports left by the Jesuits since their first arrival in Brazil to their extinction and expulsion in 1759. The research in documents written in this historical period can raise significant information about the instrumental practice in Jesuitical establishments in the Portuguese America. As well as original Jesuitical manuscripts from 16th to 18th centuries, publications, modern transcriptions or copies (handwritten, photocopied, scanned and microfilmed) from originals were used in this research too. A reading of these texts can demonstrate that the use of musical instruments is frequently mentioned in descriptions of missions in Indian settlements, while in reports about Jesuitical colleges the only instrument mentioned is the organ. This demonstrates a very close relation between instrumental practice and catechesis of Indians in Jesuitical missions in colonial Brazil, and the persistence of the usual Roman practice in the colleges.",,,,,Portuguese,REVIEW

The multinational membership of the Society of Jesus gave its missionaries access to virtually every Portuguese, Spanish, and French colony. The Society was thus compelled to engage an astonishingly diverse array of cultural and natural environments, and that diversity of contexts is reflected in the range and the complexity of Jesuit scientific practices. Underlying that complexity, however, was what I see as a unique combination of institutional structures; namely, European colleges, overseas mission stations, and the regular circulation of personnel and information. With this institutional framework as a backdrop, I briefly trace what I see as the most salient themes emerging from recent studies of Jesuit overseas science: 1) the Societys ability to use scientific expertise to its advantage amid the complex web of dependencies upon which it missionary activities rested; 2) the ability of its missionaries to become intimate with a wide range of cultures and to appropriate natural knowledge held by indigenous peoples, especially in the fields of material medica and geography; and 3) the different ways Jesuits used published accounts of “remote nature” (i.e., natural histories of overseas colonies) to advance their corporate and religious causes.",,,,,English,KEEP

The figure of this great saboian Jesuit has remained unfairly hidden, maybe overshadowed by the brightness of some other contemporary group members who, because of their responsibilities inside the Order (Ignatius or D. Laínez), becuase of their huge missionary activities (Francis Xavier) or because of their holy lives, shined with a bigger influence all along posterity.

Second, the nature of theological language was at stake: is theology merely a set of logical deductions from divinely revealed, but universally accessible, propositions, or is faith and commitment necessary to any serious grasp of the import of theological claims?

In this sense, the analysis of a manuscript commentary to De Cailo commonly attributed to Scheiner, clearly presents the resistance within the Order that accompanied the innovations Scheiner proposed regarding the layout and nature of the heavens. Indeed, this manuscript commentary to De cereal maintained the traditional view of solid celestial orbs and blamed Scheiner for his supporting the new theory of the fluidity of heavens. Therefore the commentary cannot be attributed to the Jesuit mathematician, who just represented an important target for polemics. By means of a comparison with coeval works by Jesuit philosophers and theologians form he College of Ingolstadt, we are led to conclude that the author of the commentary incorrectly attributed to Scheiner, should instead be recognized in his fellow Jesuit, Simon Felix.",,,,,Italian,REVIEW

With false and ironic deference the text poses as a humble comment to the Libra astronomica ac philosophica. Employing a dilemmatic procedure by antithesis that recalls Machiavellian prose, Il saggiatore opposes the more democratic Italian to the authoritarian Latin, the essentiality of his exposition to the redundancy of his adversary's clarity to obscurity, the precious of ""geometric demonstrations"" to approximations, referential language to metaphorical language and plays on words, the colloquial tone of familiar vocabulary to abstruse scholastic terminology the search of the consensus of competent and qualified readers to the easy seduction of an ignorant and gullible public, the conscientiousness of a long and difficult study to the superficiality of contenting oneself with disorderly producing the quotations of others. From linguistic, the contrast becomes ethical, for behind the Jesut's sophisms lies fraud, the heap of authority he invokes in defense of his theses conceals laziness, while Galileo exhibits the intellectual honesty and diligence of one who interrogates nature itself in order to advance knowledge instead of stubbornly holding on to out-dated theses.

To su: isusovačka crkva, franjevački samostan, samostan uršulinki, župna crkva Sv. Nikole i, samo uvjetno, Musikverein. Prikazujući precizno svaki od mogućih izvora autor naglašava da o prvom izvorištu ( isusovačka crkva) nije sačuvano ništa, dok se kod franjevaca (drugo izvorište) mogu naći dosta bogata građa koju u prvom redu tvore tri «omašna rukopisna kantuala s ukupno 51 misom te još jedan kantual s koralnim misama i gradualima». (To je tzv. Remetinečki kantual iz 1707. i dva kantuala o. Konrada Potočnika iz 1731. i 1732. koji su u Varaždin doprli iz Križevaca nakon ukinuća tamošnjeg samostana 1786.) U trećem izvoru, a riječ je o samostanu sestri uršulinki, nalazimo neprocjenjivo bogatstvo glazbene građe pretežno duhovne ali i svjetovne sadržajnosti što posebno dugujemo velezaslužnom znanstveniku / istraživaču ovoga grada, pok. Krešimiru Filiću. On ju je prvi pronašao i o tome iscrpno prozborio u svom Glazbenom životu Varaždina (1972.), a na osnovi njegova teksta bilo je moguće doći do partitura na temelju kojih je priređena građa za (danas označen kao «povijesni») koncert s naslovom VARAŽDINSKI SKLADATELJSKI KRUG S KRAJA XVIII. STOLJEĆA (1973.). U crkvi Sv. Nikole, kor .upne crkve sv. Nikole, bio je rasadište duhovnoga glazbenog stvaralaštva i inozemnih i varaždinskih glazbenika-orguljaša, među kojima i (najznačajnijeg) domaćeg sina L. I. Ebnera. što se tiče Musikvereina važno reći da je glazbenim priredbama sudjelovao i L. I. Ebner sa svojom kćeri i učenicom Marijom i tada nerijetko izvodio i (svjetovna) djela koncertnog/koncertantnog karaktera, nastala u minulom stoljeću. Najznačajnije za dvadeseto stoljeće su ipak Varaždinske barokne večeri koje stimuliranju istraživanja i prezentiranja glazbene bašćine hrvatskoga baroknog razdoblja. Prinos je zamašan i vrlo znakovit, posebice jer se pokazao inicirajućim putokazom za neke druge glazbene sredine u Hrvatskoj i prvim «utkivačem» takve građe u hrvatsku glazbenu svakodnevnicu.||In this text the author defines five possible sources of music baroque in Varazdin: the Jesuit Church, the Franciscan Monastery, the Ursuline Convent, parish church of St. Nicholas and the Musikverein. In his detailed description of each of the possible sources the author has emphasized that no evidence was kept of the first source (the Jesuit church). With the Franciscans (the second source) rich holding are to be found comprising first and foremost three ""large carol books with 51 masses and another carol book with choral masses and chorus psalms."" (These are the so called Remete carol book (Remetinecki kantual) of 1707 and two song books by Konrad Potocnik of 1731 and 1732 who arrived to Varazdin from Krizevci following the closure of their monastery in 1786). In the third source, the convent of the Ursulines, there is the priceless treasury of music holdings to be found including mostly spiritual but also secular topics largely due to famous scientist and researcher of this city, the late Kreimiru Filic. He was the first to find it and spoke about it in great detail in his work The Music Life of Varazdin (1972). His text represented the basis for the notes comprising the historical concert entitled ""The Late 18th Century Varadzin Composers"" (in 1973). The choir of St. Nicholas Church represented the hotbed of spirituals and foreign as well as Varazdin musicians—the organ players, including the famous L. I.Ebner. As for the Musikvereina it is worth mentioning that L. I. Ebner and his daughter and student took part in the music events and often performed (secular) concert/concert like works of the took part in the twentieth century. The most important feature of the twentieth century are the Varazdin Baroque Evenings. They encourage research and presentations of the Croatian Baroque musical heritage.

A dialogue was held with these missionaries, based on their studies.

Mnogi hrvatski isusovci zaslužni su za razvoj prirodnih znanosti. No uz one koji su sada poznati (Herman Dalmatin, Marko Antun de Dominis, Frederik Grisogono, Frane Petrić, Marin Getaldić, Ruđer Bošković i dr.) sigurno je da ima još mnogo onih kojima rad nije dosad izašao na vidjelo. Upravo zato bit će potrebno provesti još mnoga nova istraživanja kojima će biti upotpunjena naša znanja o prinosu hrvatskih isusovaca|prirodnim znanostima. Pogledom u povijest možemo reći da su Hrvati nadograđivali svojim znanstvenim spoznajama u području prirodnih znanosti kulturnu baštinu europske zajednice. U 18. stoljeću znanost se postupno institucionalizira, a u 19. stoljeću postavljaju se temelji za sustavno i moderno ulaganje u znanost. Početkom 20. stoljeća, odnosno 1905. godine, Albert Einstein uvodi nove ideje u fiziku, koje nalaze svoje sljedbenike i u Hrvatskoj. Ovdje izdvajamo i ističemo dvije žene koje su uz mnoge naše znanstvenike bile sljedbenice teorije relativnosti. Zdenka pl. Makanec, udata Blašković (17. rujna 1894. u Zagrebu–16. kolovoza 1971. u Zagrebu) objavila je radove: O relativnosti: I. Relativnost brzine, gibanja i energije (1917.); O relativnosti: II.

Varićakova pretpostavka (1961.).||The Croatian Jesuits were in the forefront of world scientific developments, and had a major role in Croatian culture and science. Many Croatian Jesuits have made a significant contribution in the field of natural sciences. However, beside those who are already famous (Hermann of Dalmatia, Marko Antun de Dominis, Frederik Grisogono, Frane Petric, Marin Getaldic, Ruder Boskovic et al.), there are others whose contributions have not been appreciated until now. Thus, there is a need for new research that would add to our knowledge about the role Croatian Jesuits played in field of natural sciences. History shows that Croatian scientists have contributed to the European cultural heritage also in the field of natural sciences. In the 18th century, science had been gradually institutionalized, while in the 19th century, the bases for systematic and modern scientific development had been formed. At the beginning of the 20th century, in 1905, Albert Einstein introduced new concepts into physics, and these new ideas found its followers also in Croatia. Here should be paid a tribute to two women who, together with many other Croatian scientists, have been the followers of the theory of relativity.

The question is, whether these are translations from one language into another, or two original pieces, and whether the author and addressee of both texts is the same? This is difficult to answer, as the author is often not indicated on the title page, not to mention the translator. In the focus of analysis in this article are a poem dialogue by Eliasz Pielgrzymowski (Pilgrimovius, c.1604) Philopatris ad senatum populumque Lituanum (1597; the Polish translation Milosnik Ojczyzny do Senatu i Rzeczypospolitej Litewskiej) and occasional publications by the Vilnius Jesuit Academy in the 17th century. It is concluded that the Polish and Latin texts do not present translations from one language into another, but rather two independent compositions, characterized by different structure, vocabulary and semantical accents. The Latin text as a rule is based on the antique literary phraseology, allusions to myths, and its nature is more abstract and universal. The addressee of such texts comprises clergy, nobility and representatives of the Academy. In the Polish text, particular popular sayings are used more frequently, and the narrative is of more intimate, emotional nature. Such texts aim at the noblemen of lower education and origins. The bilingual texts of the 16th–17th century Grand Duchy of Lithuania present plenty interesting material...",,,,,Lithuanian,REVIEW

The results of a comparison between Garzoni's treatise, Della Porta's Magia Naturalis (1589), and Gilbert's De Magnete (1600) are also summarized. As claimed in the seventeenth century by Niccolò Cabeo and Niccolò Zucchi, the treatise contains quite a lot of the material to be found subsequently in the Magia Naturalis and in the De Magnete. Most importantly, the treatise presents so many interesting features, well before Gilbert's work, which make it the first example of a modern treatment of magnetic phenomena.",,,,,English,KEEP

Our preliminary findings show that very few of the historically documented catastrophes and other marked environmental events in Quito match known El Niño episodes. Independently, the first meteorological data was collected in Ecuador (beginning with La Condamine in 1738), followed by the earliest attempts to build a national meteorological network in the 1860's, linked closely to President Gabriel García Moreno and the Jesuits. The 1925 El Niño phenomenon was the first important meteorological episode recorded with scientific instrumentation in Ecuador, with newspapers providing complementary archives about the extreme impact of this event.",,,,,English,KEEP

The crosses of self-denial teach us to shun evil and to love God, as demanded in Proverbs 8:13: [HEBREW]. God’s will must increase in us; and ours must decrease. We must possess less; and He must possess more. That is why, like Elisha, ""we burn our plows and slaughter our oxen"" (1 Kings 19:21), stepping into the darkness and fear where the voice of Our Lord resounds, ""Come, follow Me"" (Lk 9:23). Christ Himself blazed this trail for us, being wholly subject in His will to the Father, detached from things, and suffering the Cross. It is a necessary path and process – a way to ""that holiness without which no one will see the Lord"" (Heb 12:14). Von Balthasar, however, questions the apostolicity of John, and raises the possibility of ""a Christianity to different rhythms, without such contemplation [...] if we only let God."" The purpose of this paper is to dispel such notions, and to show that the contemplation as envisioned by John must never be renounced, for it is a vital element for the attainment of that perfection of holiness without which no Christian can be an authentic apostle of charity for the world.",,,,,English,REVIEW

Dizajn laboratorijskih vjezbi bazira se na sekvenci POE (Predict Observe Esplain), u kojoj studenti prvo lansiraju predvidanja s obrazlozenjima, opazaju realizaciju fenomena i poslije objasnjavaju eventualne razlike izmedu predvidenog i opazenog. Glavni problemi implementacije ove didaktike jesu otpor koji studenti pokazuju prema citanju s razumijevanjem i njihovo (pogresno) vjerovanje da je profesorovo predavanje nuzan uvjet za njihovo ucenje.||Putting students in the center of the educational process and using the results of educational research are basic characteristics of an important movement whose objective is learning improvement in many university courses. For mechanics courses there is experimental evidence that pedagogy with active students gives better results than pedagogy with active professor and passive students. In this article we present the first results of an implementation of a pedagogy which promotes active student learning in one physics course at the Jesuit University of Guadalajara (ITESO). We decided to use an implementation format in which there are no lectures and in which cognitive and meta-cognitive aspects of learning are stressed. Students gain knowledge necessary for classroom work through reading assignments. Suggestions that it is important to identify difficult to understand passages, to elaborate underdeveloped parts and to construct conceptual maps were used to promote comprehension of the text. The quality of comprehensive reading products and the results of short reading quizzes give students an opportunity to make 20% of the maximum note. In the classroom the students answer conceptual questions (in verbal format, with or without video illustrations) and solve physics problems helped by an expert-like strategy (visualization of problem situations, conceptual analysis, mathematical modeling, verbal planning of the solution path, mathematical realization of the plan, analysis of the solution, and conclusion about the role the solved problem has in gained knowledge). Laboratory practices are based on the POE sequence (Predict Observe Explain), in which students first make a prediction with justification, observe the behavior of the phenomenon and later explain any observed differences between the prediction and the observation.",,,,,Croatian,REVIEW

Odnosi se to ponajprije na njegova djela iz područja fizike, filozofije, logike i metafizike.|U središtu ovog razmatranja Zanchijeva je metafizička filozofska rasprava Disertacija o uzajamnom odnosu ljudskog duha i tijela (Dissertatio de mutuo commercio inter mentem humanam et corpus, Viennae, 1748). Sadržajno-tematski i problemski ona čini jednu od značajnih sastavnica europske filozofije prosvjetiteljstva koja doživljava u svoje i kasnija razdoblja iznimnu recepciju. Sudbina te recepcije očituje se u različitim stajalištima, tendencijama, pa i polarizacijama mišljenja (empirizam, racionalizam, deterministički mehanicizam, okazionalizam, harmonizam), kojima se pridružuje i Zanchijeva rasprava, kao i kasnija Boškovićeva O duši i Bogu. Zamjetnom filozofskom kulturom, poznavanjem starijih i novijih ideja, analizira on brojna pitanja i probleme: naravi i značenja duha i materije, tvornosti, odnosa psihičkog i fizičkog ustroja čovjeka i prirode, funkcioniranja osjetilnog i razumskog, slobodne volje i nužnosti, ljudske spoznaje, ali i osvrte na rezultate novih otkrića u znanosti (fizika, matematika, medicina) i u filozofskim teorijama (Descartes, Leibniz, Wolff, Newton, Malebranche i dr.). Disertacija je ogledalo njegova nastojanja za prevladavanjem i odbacivanjem kartezijanskog dualizma, podvojenosti mentalnog i tjelesnog automatizma, dviju međusobno nezavisnih supstancija i teorije prestabilirane harmonije, te ukazivanje na proturječja, nedosljednosti i neodrživosti spomenutih teorija. Zanchijevo obrazlaganje i dokazivanje uzajamnosti psihofizičkog djelovanja nije lišeno duga spram tradicionalnih rješenja, ali nije ni zatvoreno prodoru novih ideja i hipoteza. Uvjeren u ograničenost i nesavršenost ljudske spoznaje, spomenuti odnos Zanchi vidi kao jedno od otvorenih pitanja mišljenja njegova vremena, ali ono se produžuje u filozofijskom diskursu današnjeg vremena, ostajući tako jednim od priloga svagda aktualnoj povijesti mišljenja.",,,,,Croatian,REVIEW

The quantum phenomena make it possible to conclude that the basis of the material world is nonmaterial; that the nature of reality is that of an indivisible wholeness; and that elementary particles possess aspects of consciousness in a rudimentary way. The quantum perspective of evolution makes it possible to conclude that the emergence of complex order in the biosphere is not from nothing (ex nihilo) but by the actualization of virtual quantum states—that is, by actualizing empty states which are part of the mathematical structure of material systems, representing a logical order that is not real in a material sense but, predetermined by system conditions, has the potential to become real in quantum jumps.
