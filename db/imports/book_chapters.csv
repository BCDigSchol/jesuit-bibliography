The bibliography contains entries for over 1,600 sermons by over a hundred ministers affiliated with eight denominations. The compilation provides a previously unavailable major tool for research into the early South. Richard Beale Davis began the bibliography in 1946 as part of his research for Intellectual Life in the Colonial South, 1585–1763, which won the National Book Award in history. Michael A. Lofaro took over the project in 1976, expanded the colonial entries (pre-1764), and added the period of 1764–1799. George M. Barringer contributed entries for Jesuit sermons. Sandra G. Hancock contributed those for Thomas Cradock. The bibliography is also available online (dlc.lib.utk.edu/sermons). This database contains the same in-depth descriptions of these sermons, over 90 percent of which are unknown. It provides multiple avenues of access. Searches can be constructed and limited by single or combined criteria of author, repository, book of the Bible, date, state, denomination, keyword, and short title. Scholars can employ both versions of this tool to construct a more complete picture of the southern mind before 1800 and to reveal how that mind contributes to a national ethos. The bibliography will aid many disciplines -- religion, cultural and American studies, history, literature, political science, sociology, psychology, and more -- and all those who wish to interpret the past and its effect upon the present. It will lead to a more balanced appraisal of American intellectual history by encouraging access to a large body of southern sermons to place alongside those of the northern and middle states for critical assessment. - Publisher.",George M.

Assisting them in this effrt were Indian catechists—local Christians who were employed as interpreters and religious intermediaries. This study examines in detail a catechist rebellion that took place in Madurai in 1700, when three Tamil catechists approached the local ruler and demanded that their spiritual leader and employer, the French Jesuit Jean Venant Bouchet, be expelled from the region. This detailed account of the catechist rebellion, and an examination of its subsequent narration in the collection of Jesuit letters published in France as Lettres édifiantes et curieuses, reveals the complex relationship between the Jesuit missionaries and the native converts they employed. The catechist rebellion demonstrates the multi-layered and sometimes contradictory expectations to which the missionaries held their catechists. Although catechists are mentioned in the Jesuit letters only in passing, and then in mostly positive terms, this work argues that the relationship between Jesuit sand catechists should be understood as both central to the Jesuit experience in India, and as one in which the missionaries exhibited a muted anger toward the catechists. Therefore, the catechist rebellion in Madurai should not be understood as a rupture, but rather as a an extreme instantiation of the tensions and conflicts common to Jesuit-catechist relations.",,,,,English,KEEP|REVIEW

Martin and Mark A. Nicholas gather emerging and leading voices in the study of Native American religion to reconsider the complex and often misunderstood history of Native people's engagement with Christianity and with Euro-American missionaries. Surveying mission encounters from contact through the mid-nineteenth century, the volume alters and enriches our understanding of both American Christianity and indigenous religion. The essays here explore a variety of post-contact identities, including indigenous Christians, mission friendly"" non-Christians, and ex-Christians, thereby exploring the shifting world of Native-white cultural and religious exchange. Rather than questioning the authenticity of Native Christian experiences, these scholars reveal how indigenous peoples negotiated change with regard to missions, missionaries, and Christianity. This collection challenges the pervasive stereotype of Native Americans as culturally static and ill-equipped to navigate the roiling currents associated with colonialism and missionization.""--Pub. desc.",,,,,English,KEEP|REVIEW

It describes his positive vision of Judaism in relation to Christian faith, and how he developed his new vision, while preserving the primacy of Christianity. After administering various pastoral duties, Joseph Bonsirven was drafted in 1914. He was made a prisoner of war in 1916. During this time, Benedict XV ordered him to teach dogmatic theology and Holy Scripture in an improvised seminary in the war prison camp of Munster, Germany. Between 1926 and 1928, Father Bonsirven published a column on contemporary Judaism in the journal Études. On the one hand, he takes a positive and personalized approach to the Jewish people and to Judaism. On the other hand, he feels obliged to disparage Israel, in order to safeguard the superiority of Christianity and the church. He never fully abandons the theology of substitution.",,,,,English,CULL|REVIEW

This book addresses an important and central aspect of these neglected materials Leibniz's writings on two mysteries central to Christian thought, the Trinity and the Incarnation. From Antognazza's study emerges a portrait of a thinker surprisingly receptive to traditional Christian theology and profoundly committed to defending the legitimacy of truths beyond the full grasp of human reason. This view of Leibniz differs strikingly from traditional perceptions of the philosopher as a hard rationalist and quasi-deist. Antognazza also sets Leibniz's writings in the context of the important theological controversies of his day.",Translated from the Italian.,,,,English,CULL|REVIEW

Whereas the Jesuits made a profound impact on the architecture of other parts of the world - notably Baroque Italy, central Europe, and Flanders - Jesuit monuments played a paradigmatic role in certain regions of Latin America, frequently inspiring trends that would prevail for decades thanks to structural, stylistic, and decorative innovations. Such were the cuzqueño Baroque, a bold and unique variant of Baroque architecture that arose phoenix-like from the rubble of the 1650 Cuzco earthquake, and the so-called “Mestizo Style,” an extraordinarily creative movement in architectural sculpture that spread rapidly through the southern Andes between the 1660s and the 1820s. In other regions, such as modern-day Paraguay, parts of Argentina, and lowland Bolivia, the Jesuits so dominated the built environment that Jesuit architecture and regional architecture were one and the same. Despite this profound architectural legacy in colonial Latin America, the Jesuits did not promote any single style. In fact, the buildings they constructed from Baja California to Chilean Patagonia were noteworthy for their lack of stylistic unity, the result both of their policy of adaptation to regional and indigenous forms and the unusually international background of Jesuit architects and designers.",,,,,English,KEEP|REVIEW

However, this new preoccupation with the fragility and ephemerality of China paradoxically allowed it to continue to play a robust and elastic role in the British cultural imagination. The analysis of fictional texts about China contributes to the increasing seriousness with which the cult of chinoiserie is being treated by economic and cultural historians. The chapter considers four groups of fictional sources, first, oriental tales with a Chinese setting by Thomas-Simon Gueullette, Hoamchi-Vam, Thomas Percy, and Horace Walpole; second, the group of tragic plays about Chinese orphans written by figures as diverse as Voltaire and Elkanah Settle; third, the representation of China as an empire of Dulness in poetry and fiction relating to Alexander Pope's Dunciad; and fourth, published letters written in the voice of the Chinese informant, of which Oliver Goldsmith's Citizen of the World is the most impressive, if late, example.",,,,,English,CULL|REVIEW

The perception or rather, the different discourses about the images in the Portuguese speaking world and their relations to the Italian post-Tridentine debate were rather disregarded. This concerns today rather less known theologians like the influential archbishop of Braga from the Dominican order, Bartholomew of Braga or Bartholomeus a Martyribus and some one hundred years later the famous Jesuit author Antônio Vieira. In the Portuguese reception by theologians and preachers like Bartholomew of Braga and Antônio Vieira we can not only find a reception of these ideas, but a significant development of its theological fundaments like in Bartholomew or, especially in Vieira, a deepening of these concepts.",,,,,English,CULL|REVIEW

While there are many different anti-Jewish and anti-Jesuit texts and representations, the chapter selects a few individual works, particularly from the late 16th century, as representative for the sake of an initial analysis. The age of confessionalization was one of consolidation, in which traditional motifs were continued, recirculated, and used in new ways that would shape European religion and politics well into modernity. The representation of outsider groups, such as Jews and Jesuits, was utilized fully in this process.",,,,,English,KEEP|REVIEW

Monasticne ustanove, benediktinske opatije na obrobju slovenskega ozemlja in kasneje v 12. stoletju kartuzije ter cistercijanske opatije, med katerimi je posebej izstopala Sticna, so bile najpomembnejsa sredisca teoloskega studija. Ohranjeno knjizno gradivo razlocno spricuje, da je teoloska misel, ki je oblikovala Evropo, bila doma tudi na Slovenskem. V skladu z odloki tridentinskega koncila 1589 v Gornjem Gradu zacne delovati skofijsko semenisce, razvejano in v smislu tridentinskih nacel razgibano studijsko dejavnost razvijajo posamezni redovi (franciskani, jezuiti, kapucini). Svojevrsten pecat teoloskemu studiju dajo jozefinske reforme, ki zatro skofijske in redovne bogoslovne sole ter uvedejo ""generalna semenisca"", znana po izrazito ""usmerjenem"" izobrazevanju v duhu jozefinskega drzavnega cerkvenstva, kar v pastoralni dejavnosti tako izobrazene in vzgojene duhovscine odmeva se preko sredine 19. stoletja. Krajsa vmesna epizoda: Francozi v casu Ilirskih provinc (1809–1813) v Ljubljani 1810 uvedejo Centralne sole, pravo univerzo s pravico podeljevanja akademskih naslovov; med sedmimi fakultetami je tudi teoloska. Po odhodu Francozov skrb za teoloski studij spet prevzamejo posamezne skofije. Pomembno mesto je dobilo 1818 obnovljeno semenisce v Gorici za bogoslovce goriske, trzaske, krske in poreske skofije. Leta 1859, ko Maribor postane skofijsko mesto, skof A. M. Slomsek tod odpre tudi bogoslovno solo. Leta 1898 je tu zacela izhajati prva slovenska teoloska revija Voditelj v bogoslovnih vedah; v njej so poleg mariborskih bogoslovnih profesorjev sodelovali se drugi iz vse Slovenije. Revija je zajela precejsen krog bralcev in spodbujala teolosko-znanstvena prizadevanja na sirsem obmocju nase domovine. Teoloska misel se je poglabljala in sirila tudi s tem, da je vrsta bodocih profesorjev teologije studirala na razlicnih univerzah po Evropi (Rim, Dunaj, Pariz, Oxford). Po vzpostavitvi drzave SHS so ustanovitev ljubljanske univerze pripravljali tudi bogoslovni profesorji. Z njeno ustanovitvijo 1919 se je bogoslovno ucilisce preoblikovalo v teolosko fakulteto.||The beginnings of theological studies in Slovenia are connected with the Christianization of the Slovenes. The most important centres of theological studies were monastic schools, Benedictine abbeys on the periphery of the Slovenian territory and later in the 12th century the Charterhouses and Cistercian abbeys, the Sticna Abbey in particular. The presence of the theological thought that shaped Europe has been well attested also in Slovenia in the books preserved. Following the decrees of the Council of Trent, a diocesan seminary was opened in Gornji Grad in 1589. On the other hand, the religious orders (the Franciscans, the Jesuits and the Capuchins) developed diversified and dynamic study activities in accordance with the decrees of the Council of Trent. Under Josephinism, the monastic schools and diocesan houses of studies were suppressed. Introduced were ""general seminaries"", noted for the professionally oriented education in the spirit of Josephinistic state-church idea (Staatskirchentum). This left a strong mark on the pastoral activities of the clergy through the mid-19th century. A short intermediate episode: In the period of the Illyrian Provinces (1809–1813), the French introduced Central schools in Ljubljana, a proper University with the right of conferring degrees. Included among the seven faculties was also the Faculty of Theology. After the departure of the French, the responsibility for theological studies was again assumed by the dioceses. An important place was given to the seminary in Gorizia which was restored in 1818 for the seminarians from the dioceses of Gorica, Trieste, Krka and Porec. In 1859, Bishop Anton Martin Slomsek transferred the episcopal seat to the city of Maribor and also open a Theological College. In 1898, the first Slovene theological journal Voditelj v bogoslovnih vedah (A Guide to Theological Disciplines) was published th re. Articles for the journal were contributed not only by the lecturers of theology from Maribor but from all over Slovenia. The journal included a considerable circle of readers and promoted the theological-scientific efforts in the broader area of our country. The theological thought deepened and expanded also due to the fact that many future lecturers of theology studied at different universities across Europe (Rome, Vienna, Paris, Oxford). After the establishment of the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs, also the professors of theology took an active part in the foundation of the University of Ljubjana. With its establishment in 1991, the Theological College was transformed into the Faculty of Theology.",,,,,Slovenian,CULL|REVIEW

It discusses the participation of approximately 50 French Jesuits in this religious insurrection, their description of it as a ""spiritual resistance"". Both totalitarianism and the Vichy regime reinforced the conviction among resisters that what was at stake in the activity was their very ""soul"", a motif constantly sounded in their communications. One of the traits of this spiritual resistance was its communal character and ecumenical reach. This spiritual resistance was characterized by its frontal assault on racist ideology and on the anti-Semitism justified by it.

In 1560, he began his studies at the Collegio Romano. He then studied Thomistic theology at the University of Padua. In 1569, Bellarmine taught divinity at the University of Louvain and was ordained priest the following year. In 1576, he was recalled to Italy and assigned the chair of Controversies recently founded at the Collegio Romano (where he originally studied theology). Bellarmine established Thomistic theology as foundational for the Jesuit order and eventually for all theological education of Roman Catholicism (although his doctrine of free will is closer to Molina). The series of lectures delivered at the Collegio Romano became Bellarmine's most influential writings under the title Disputationes de Controversiis Christianae Fidei Adversus Huius Temporis Haereticos (1586–1593; “Disputations Concerning the Controversies of the Christian Faith against the Heretics of this Time”). De Controversiis was an articulate and uncompromising systematization of Roman Catholic doctrine. His work could rightly be considered the most detailed defense of Romanist teaching; it was influential in Europe, and was a serious challenge to Protestantism especially in Germany and England. Bellarmine was a resolute opponent toward Protestantism and quickly became the leading apologist of the Catholic Church during the Counter-Reformation. As a shrewd controversialist on the side of Rome, he refined the futurist interpretation of Jesuit Francisco Ribera of Salamanca, Spain against the dominant historical interpretation of the Protestant Reformers.",,,,,English,CULL|REVIEW

In many cases, their theological writings are dealt with for the first time in this book. It is surprising how much theological material there is and how little commentators have dealt with it. Apart from the critical engagement with the way they use theology, the book also explores how their theological writings infiltrate and enrich their Marxist work.

This interest, subsequently expanded to include other forms of sense perception, has also led to a renewed scholarly attention for Jesuit spirituality and for the artistic, theatrical, and literary endeavors associated with it. As Calvino discussed the concept of compositio loci, he noted that Ignatius distinguished between visible meditation and an invisible variant. In contrast, the invisible contemplation was appropriate, for example, for the meditation of sins. As confession became an ever more sophisticated art, other classification systems were introduced. The most important was the Ten Commandments, but there were others as well: the gifts of the Holy Spirit, the works of mercy, the occupational sins, and also those of the five senses.",,,,,English,CULL|REVIEW

Each in his own way is prophetic, visionary, and radical in trying to promote a cognitive and moral breakthrough in human history. Berrigan, of course, in Brown’s view, is obviously prophetic, visionary, and radical, but Lonergan is also in a less obvious way. Brown nails down this thesis by showing how Lonergan’s early philosophy of history underpins and informs all of his later work, and how his economic theory attempts to provide a more adequate alternative to both conventional capitalist and conventional state socialist alternatives. Lonergan’s radical, philosophical, theological, social, and historical theory compliments Berrigan’s radical prophetic politics and resistance, and vica versa.",,,,,English,KEEP|REVIEW

He is a non-Galilean scientist whose general attitude is not obscurantism but rather a defense of established faith. He arrives in Rome in the fall of 1633 when he is in his thirties. Even if at the epoch Kircher has already written some of his many books, it is amazing that Galileo does not even quote him in the letters he will wrote in the rest of his life. In spite of having stridden along a minor scientific path, opposite of that shown by Galileo, it is nonetheless surprising to find out that Athanasius Kircher was gifted with remarkable intuition, and was in some cases even decades in advance with respect to the age he lived in.","Proceedings of a conference held October 18–23, 2009 in Venezia, Italy.|Type of Work:  Conference publication",,,,English,CULL|REVIEW

This movement has been the single most important force in the development of what is sometimes called the new history . Renowned cultural historian, Peter Burke, distinguishes between four main generations in the development of the Annales School. The first generation included Lucien Febvre and Marc Bloch, who fought against the old historical establishment and founded the journal Annales to encourage interdisciplinary collaboration. The second generation was dominated by Fernand Braudel, whose magnificent work on the Mediterranean has become a modern classic. The third generation, deeply associated with the cultural turn in historical scholarship, includes recently well-known historians such as Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie, Jacques Le Goff and Georges Duby. This new edition brings us right up to the present, and contemplates the work of a fourth generation, including practitioners such as Roger Chartier, Serge Gruzinski and Jacques Revel. This new generation continued much of the cultural focus of the previous Annales historians, while diversifying further, and becoming increasingly reflexive , a move that owes much to the sociocultural theories of Michel Foucault, Michel de Certeau and Pierre Bourdieu. Wide-ranging yet concise, this new edition of a classic work of analysis of one of the most important historical movements of the twentieth century will be welcomed by students of history and other social sciences and by the interested general reader.",,,,,English,CULL|REVIEW

The first and most compelling event was the arrival of Dutch and Belgian Jesuits into the American West. The Marquette Jesuits may have had opinions but they did not publicly express them, or at least there is no surviving record of such opinions. The Bennett Law was repealed in 1891. Jewish students could and did participate fully in Marquette student life. The clear indication of the articles was that Jewish students were fully and completely a part of Marquette University life.",,,,,English,KEEP|REVIEW

F., 1904–1984","This chapter explicates Bernard Lonergan's use of the phrase, “the passionateness of being” and traces the import of this phrase to Lonergan's notion of the implicit and explicit paradigms that shape human ways of thinking, feeling, and judgment. Each individual has an unconscious, implicit “metaphysics” operating in one's life: one's assumptions and ideologies—inherited from parents, friends, culture, and religion—become the unconscious paradigm of one's reality. Lonergan's contribution is to propose that there is another “First Philosophy” inherent in human beings as well, one which comes from the sense of reality built into our cognitional structure. This innate, explicit metaphysics or First Philosophy has to do with reflective self-awareness, what Lonergan calls “self-appropriation”. Byrne shows how the notion of self-appropriation is connected to theology, how it becomes, in effect, the major task of theology: to self-appropriate God's self-gift of passionate, unconditional love as rendered in the Christian traditions, so as to move us to preach this passionate love and transform the world.",,,,,English,CULL|REVIEW

Britain now possessed a vast American empire stretching from Canada to the Florida Keys, yet the crushing costs of maintaining it would push its colonies toward rebellion. White settlers, free to pour into the West, clashed as never before with Indian tribes struggling to defend their way of life. In the Northwest, Pontiac's War brought racial conflict to its bitterest level so far. Whole ethnic groups migrated, sometimes across the continent: it was 1763 that saw many exiled settlers from Acadia in French Canada move again to Louisiana, where they would become Cajuns. Calloway unfurls this panoramic canvas with vibrant narrative skill, peopling his tale with memorable characters such as William Johnson, the Irish baronet who moved between Indian campfires and British barracks; Pontiac, the charismatic Ottawa chieftain; and James Murray, Britains first governor in Quebec, who fought to protect the religious rights of his French Catholic subjects. Most Americans know the significance of the Declaration of Independence or the Emancipation Proclamation, but not the Treaty of Paris. Yet 1763 was a year that shaped our history just as decisively as 1776 or 1862. This captivating book shows why.",,,,,English,CULL|REVIEW

The emergence of the natural sciences is no exception. Just three years before the first publication of Nicolaus Copernicus' De Revolutionibus, the Society of Jesus was officially founded in 1540. Eleven years later, we see the beginnings of what eventually became the Roman College, a center of learning whose influence regarding theology and natural philosophy extended over all Europe and beyond. The Jesuits' apostolic style took shape therefore during the turbulent years of the birth and development of natural science. The scientific revolution has been studied in various ways. Some early accounts favor a so-called Whig interpretation whereby the sequence of events is seen as a steady, victorious march from the age of darkness towards the light. Other, more responsible accounts reconstruct the narrative in terms of paradigm-shifts. In many of these accounts, the Jesuit project in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries is often portrayed as ending in a tragic failure. Jesuits are depicted as being at first favorable to the new science. There is then the decree from higher authorities that blocks their open attitude; and henceforth they become the major resistance to scientific progress. The result of their opposing efforts in this area is then portrayed as a total failure. Fortunately, more recent accounts of how science develops are more sophisticated and responsible. Imre Lakatos proposed that our main focus should be on research programs.",,,,,English,KEEP|REVIEW

E in questa frastagliata e polimorfa ""riforma cattolica"", un posto di rilievo occupano naturalmente la compagnia di Gesù e i suoi uomini più rappresentativi. Tra questi è presente e freneticamente operante Antonio Possevino, gesuita mantovano, diplomatico al servizio di diversi pontefici, segretario della compagnia di Gesù, ma soprattutto fondatore indefesso di collegi ed università e scrittore prolifico e non sempre di ""scuola"". Possevino è figura prismatica, poliedrica, fortemente caratterizzata. Ha attraversato tutto il dopo concilio di Trento con la determinazione del combattente della fede e con la consapevolezza acuta della rilevanza della cultura nell'ordinamento politico delle società e nella formazione delle singolarità.Perciò dialoga con i grandi del tempo. Sullo sfondo si intravedono Vives, Lutero, Erasmo, Pico, Comenio, Huarte e quanti facevano storia: storia politica, storia religiosa, storia culturale... e ""storia della formazione"". Perciò egli si muove per influenzare teste e cuori. E perciò fonda collegi e università. |Profondamente convinto che la battaglia religiosa non sarà vinta sul principio del cuius regio, ma sulla formazione delle culture, egli giocherà tutte le sue carte sull'istruzione e l'educazione: in direzione di un pronunciato favore per il libero arbitrio, e nella prospettiva di un necessario allargamento dei fruitori di cultura e di idonee e qualificate istituzioni culturali. Questo testo ne da significativa testimonianza.",,,,,Italian,CULL|REVIEW

An articulated narrative structure can be found in the images and in their verbal ‘déclaration’; the verbal-visual interaction and the visual structures guide the quest for information. The reader is represented in the images by different types of ‘delegates’ and convoked by different devices.
