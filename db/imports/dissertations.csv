Dissertation,,2006,Les jésuites à Taïwan de 1951 à 1975,"Lyon, France",Université Lumière,605,PhD diss.,,,,,20th century,Foreign Missions -- History -- Regional,Asia -- Taiwan,"Ricci, Matteo, 1552–1610","On peut dater le début de la mission jésuite à Taiwan avec l’arrivée de Paul O’Brien en septembre 1951. Le régime en place est alors celui du gouvernement de Chiang Kai-shek et notre étude se propose d’explorer l’implantation des Jésuites sur l’île sous le régime de Chiang Kai-shek. La problématique s’organise principalement autour de deux thèmes. Le premier concerne le contexte dans lequel s’intègrent les Jésuites: quelle est l’influence sur la mission jésuite du contexte politique que connaît alors Taiwan? Comment les autorités tentent-elles d’exercer leur influence sur les Jésuites et l’Eglise taiwanaise? Quelles sont les caractéristiques des relations que tissent les Jésuites avec le pouvoir politique? La politique nationale suprême de la contre-offensive sur le continent et de l’anti-communisme a-t-elle un impact sur la mission jésuite? Quels sont les effets de l’idéologique politique du Guomindang sur l’action des Jésuites? Le deuxième thème est centré sur les initiatives mêmes des Jésuites: les démarches pour implanter l’Eglise, les raisons de leurs succès ou de leurs échecs, les obstacles rencontrés dans leurs missions et enfin, leurs rapports avec la société taiwanaise. Cette étude nous conduira à explorer la mutation que connaît l’entreprise missionnaire menée par les Jésuites, depuis son avènement jusqu’à son déclin. Le sujet est vaste mais notre ambition n’est pas de découvrir toutes les raisons expliquant l’essor et le déclin de la mission jésuite à Taiwan. Nous nous focaliserons sur celles relatives à l’action du gouvernement et au contexte social. L’essor économique que connaît Taiwan sous Chiang Kai-shek a une grande influence sur la vie de l’Eglise taiwanaise, de même que le changement de la vie familiale et des mentalités. Nous nous limiterons à l’étude des facteurs de changement ayant trait à la mission jésuite, tels que l’émigration des habitants et la mutation de la société à travers l’éducation et le travail. Nous porterons une attention particulière à la manière dont les Jésuites appréhendent la culture locale, pour adapter aux indigènes la doctrine catholique. Pour mieux comprendre les caractéristiques de la mission jésuite, nous chercherons notamment à montrer en quoi les Jésuites évoluent de l’“adaptation” à l’“inculturation”. Nous tenterons, à partir des notions d’inculturation et d’adaptation, d’analyser la rencontre entre la doctrine catholique présentée par les Jésuites et la vie du peuple taiwanais; nous montrerons également les réactions des Jésuites face aux problèmes rencontrés: la gestion des œuvres missionnaires, la pédagogie jésuite et l’approche du peuple en sont autant de facettes. La question de l’inculturation est centrale dans notre étude. Bien que la théorie de l’inculturation se constitue à partir des années 1980, notre étude s’enrichira à la lumière de cette théorie, y compris pour explorer les missions jésuites en Chine du temps de Matteo Ricci et également pour analyser l’action jésuite à Taiwan dans la deuxième moitié du XXe siècle. Afin de mieux comprendre les caractéristiques des missions jésuites à Taiwan, nous insisterons en premier lieu, dans la structure de notre étude, sur l’origine des Jésuites de Taiwan, leurs rapports avec les autorités ecclésiales taiwanaises, avec le gouvernement taiwanais et avec la Curie Généralice de Rome. En se confrontant aux éléments culturels du contexte social taiwanais, les Jésuites subissent l’influence des autorités religieuses et politiques qui est a fortiori importante et directe. En deuxième lieu, pour observer l’impact du gouvernement nationaliste sur l’action des Jésuites, nous analyserons trois facettes de l’exercice de son pouvoir: les règlements juridiques, le Service de renseignements et les mouvements culturels. De façon plus précise, notre étude poursuit sept objectifs: 1) Présenter le contexte que rencontrent les Jésuites dans leur mission tant dans la pastorale que dans l’évangélisation, et les réactions qu’elles génèrent. 2) Explorer le rôle du gouvernement taiwanais et l’influence de son idéologie politique sur l’inculturation de la mission jésuite. 3) Découvrir les éléments liés à l’action du gouvernement qui entravent la mission. 4) Mettre en évidence le rôle et l’action de l’épiscopat dans la mission jésuite. 5) Analyser l’attitude des croyants et des non croyants envers la mission jésuite. 6) Etudier les solutions des Jésuites face aux problèmes de leur mission, et les conséquences qui en découlent. 7) Montrer l’évolution de l’adaptation de la mission jésuite et soulever le problème de l’inculturation. Avec la priorité nationale de la sinisation, la ligne de conduite adoptée par les Jésuites et les clercs chinois coïncide en partie avec celle impulsée par les autorités nationalistes. Cette étude s’intéresse aux impacts de l’idéologie politique sur le processus continu de l’adaptation théologique et liturgique poursuivie par les Jésuites. Nous tenterons de savoir si l’inculturation théologique menée par les Jésuites s’harmonise avec les réalités locales et correspond aux attentes des Taiwanais.| |We can precise the date of the beginning of the Jesuit mission in Taiwan with the arrival of Paul O’Brien in September 1951. The regime was then the government of Chiang Kai-shek. Our studies propose is to explore the Jesuits’ implantation on this island under the regime of Chiang Kai-shek. The problematical issue is principally organized around two themes. The first concerns the context in which the Jesuits were integrated: what kind of influence was exercised on their mission in this political context? How did the authorities exercise their influence on the Jesuits and the Taiwanese Church? What were the characteristics of the relationship that weaved the Jesuits with the political authority? Did the supreme national policy of the counter-attack on the continent and the anti-communism have an impact on the Jesuit mission? Which were the effects of the Guomindang’s ideological policy on the Jesuit’s action? The second theme is centered on the Jesuits’ initiatives: the approaches for implanting the Church, the reasons of their success or of their failure, the obstacles met in their missions and their contributions to the Taiwanese society. This study allows us to explore the mutation of the Jesuits’ missionary action, from its very begin to its decline. The subject is vast but our ambition is by no means to discover all the reasons explaining the rapid expansion and the decline of the Jesuits’ mission in Taiwan. Our focus spots on the reasons relating the government’s action and the social context. The economic rapid development during the Chiang’s government had an important influence on the Church, as well as on the change of the familial life and the mentality. We limit our issue in the study of the factors of changes concerning the Jesuits’ mission, just like the inhabitants’ emigration and the mutation of the society through education and employment. We pay a particular attention on the way of which the Jesuits apprehend the local culture, for adapting to the local people the Catholicism. In order to understand better the characteristics of Jesuits’ mission, we try to demonstrate how the Jesuits evolve their action from the “adaptation” to the “inculturation”. Basing on the notions of inculturation and of adaptation, we attempt to analyze the encounter between the catholic doctrine presented by the Jesuits and the Taiwanese people’s life; their reactions regarding to the problems will be studied: the management of missionary works and the ways of approaching the people are of these fields. The issue of inculturation is essential in our study. Even though the theory of the inculturation forms since the 1980’s, our study gets enriched in the light of this theory, including for exploring the Jesuits’ missions in China in the time of Matteo Ricci and equally for analyzing the Jesuits’ action in Taiwan in the 20th century. In order to understand better the characteristics of the Jesuits’ missions in Taiwan, first of all, we start from their origin of these missions, their relationship with the ecclesial authorities, with the Taiwanese government and the Jesuits’ leadership in Rome. Integrated in the Taiwanese social context, the Jesuits were subjected to the influence of the religious and political authorities that was a fortiori important and direct. Secondly, we attempt to analyze the impact of the nationalist government on the Jesuits’ action through three aspects of its political power: the juridical regulations, the intelligence network and the cultural movements.",(Lyon),,French
Dissertation,,2006,The Origin and Nature of Political and Spiritual Power: Natural Rights and Natural Law in the Thought of Francisco Suarez,"Washington, DC",Catholic University of America,300,PhD diss.,,,,,16th century|17th century,Philosophy -- Law|Political Thought|Philosophy -- Scholasticism,,"Suárez, Francisco, 1548–1617","This dissertation concerns the political thought of the 16th century thinker Francisco Suarez. Among some political theorists and historians, there is a continuing debate surrounding the origins and nature of liberal democracy. Some place Suarez in a line of thought which has its foundations in the medieval jurists and later scholastic theologians and which is then developed by the more modern thinkers, such as Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau, while others see the modern thinkers as departing from Suarez. In addition, most commentators ignore or give little attention to key areas of his work pertaining to church/state relations and subjective natural rights and natural law---both of which are important factors in assessing his relationship to liberal democracy. Although Suarez writes of a ""state of nature,"" two ""social contracts,"" political power and popular sovereignty, and subjective natural rights and law, he has a specific qualified understanding of these notions which are rooted in his overall hierarchical view of God and nature, and the political and ecclesial powers and communities. Consequently, whatever he claims regarding the naturalness and ""independence"" and ""autonomy"" of the political order, he does not retreat from the supernatural and spiritual order. The connection between these two orders manifests itself most especially in the relation between the political power and the spiritual power of the Church under the rubric of the indirect power of the pope in temporal matters. Suarez distinguishes between the non-Christian king and kingdom and the Christian king and kingdom, resulting in two different relations between the two powers. Furthermore, Suarez does claim that there are subjective natural rights that have their ultimate foundation in the fact that man is made in the image of God, and is master of himself. These rights are understood in connection with man's social nature, whereby man lives in community with others in order that he might reach the end for which he was created. Laws are a primary means to lead man to this end. Thus, any natural rights that one possesses are always conditioned by these laws, especially the natural moral law which gives rights their purposeful direction.",,,English

En effet, en 1690 le jeune officier de plume Robert Challe, les gardes de la Marine Pouchot de Chantassin et Lenfant, le sociétaire des Missions Etrangères le père Charmot et le jésuite père Tachard décrivent de manière très réaliste la vie quotidienne à bord du premier armement mixte français armé pour la Compagnie des Indes orientales et pour Louis XIV. La navigation, les batailles navales, les tempêtes, les conflits politiques et commerciaux et le monde exotique découvert ou entrevu à terre constituent la trame d’un véritable protocole descriptif. En 1721, en revanche, l’imprimé du Challe vieillissant se métamorphose en un véritable roman de la mer. L’étude de l’écriture maritime a une nouvelle fois mis en relief toute l’ambiguïté de la narration viatique.| |A crucial and hitherto unpublished insider’s account of the living conditions of seafarers in te late 17 century, the diaries and relations of a travel in East India in 1690 offer a wealth of information and resources on the subject. Young officer Robert Challe, navy guards Pouchot de Chantassin and Lenfant, Father Charmot — member of les Missions Etrangères (Foreign Missions) — and a Jesuit priest, Father Tachard give us a realistic description of everyday life on the first French watercraft armed for the East India Company (the Compagnie des Indes Orientales) and Louis XIV. Seafaring, battles, storms, political strife and trade wars, together with the discovery of an exotic world “discovered” for the first time, make up the thread of te narrative. Later, in an account dated 1721, however, the ageing Challe’s narrative style is found to have evolved into novel-writing. This specific study of maritime writing thus shows once more the ambiguity of any travel narrative.",,,French
Dissertation,,2008,"Qing China's Perspectives on India, 1750–1847",Cambridge,Harvard University,"xiv, 553",PhD diss.,,,,,18th century,Foreign Missions -- History -- Regional|Foreign Missions -- Politics|Foreign Missions -- Primary Sources -- Letters,Asia -- China|Asia -- India,,"Concentrating on the case of India, this dissertation examines how Qing rulers, officials, and scholars gathered and interpreted information about the outside world, and how this guided actual or proposed policies. It examines official correspondence and private geographic and statecraft scholarship to outline how India was described in various religious and intellectual traditions of the empire, and in intelligence from the Tibetan, Xinjiang, and maritime frontiers. Based on an analysis of Qing geographic methods, strategic thought and bureaucratic procedures, this dissertation argues that the framework guiding perspectives on India shifted between 1750 and 1847 from a frontier policy to the beginnings of a foreign policy. Frontier policy divided the outside world into discrete units tied to a particular frontier, and analyzed them largely according to local informants and sources. Regional differences in terminology and intelligence made it difficult to commensurate all available information into a single picture. However, by the 1840s Chinese statecraft scholars, particularly Wei Yuan, were able to integrate most available geographic information, and on this basis proposed for the first time a foreign policy that put all imperial frontiers to the service of a single strategic end: the destruction of the British empire in India. Chapter One examines knowledge of India circulating within the empire around 1750. Chapter Two examines the views of India held by the Qianlong emperor and his court, and their influence on private scholarship. Chapter Three examines official cartography and its relationship to Jesuit world maps. Collectively, these chapters argue that Qing scholarship was characterized by 'geographic agnosticism,' considering but not wholly endorsing a range of conflicting geographic conceptions, leading to a great variety of idiosyncratic individual worldviews but no basis for a consensus about the outside world. Chapters Four and Five examine the Qing bureaucracy's response to the rise of British India across several frontiers, paying particular attention to the Macartney embassy and its legacy. Chapter Six examines the growth of private scholarship about India. Chapters Seven and Eight examine the Opium War and its aftermath, showing how the strategic importance of India was grasped and responded to in private statecraft-oriented writings.",,,English

Dissertation,,2010,Moralismo y el mundo cervantino en Las novelas ejemplares: A Thesis,Laredo,Texas A&M International University,"vi, 170",MA thesis,,,,,,Literature -- Edifying Literature|Theology -- Devotional Literature,Europe,,"This thesis attempts to explore the relation of the meaning and content with the form of Cervantes' Novelas ejemplares. The thesis explores the roots of the novellas in certain currents in philosophy, theology and literature. Casuistry, which had permeated the Novelas ejemplares; the very premise of the twelve examples or ""ejemplos"" is rooted in casuistry. The thesis focuses on the recurring moralistic theme which flows through and ties together the novellas: the shaping of the male and female identity, the development of disinterested love and the sacrament of marriage. This message also has it's roots in seventeenth century though, during which period the Council of Trent revised regulations in regards to formal marriages. Cervantes did not hesitate to employ the use of different genres, including the novella from Italy, the Picaresque novel, the Byzantine novel and others; however, the study reveals that Cervantes adapted these genres to his own ends and never fell into the trap of imitation or the box of categorization. Cervantes plays with these genres in order to give the reader a multidimensional view of reality, in which reality is never linear or simple, but always complex and deceiving. It is this deception and complexity which often fuels the suspense in the novellas. Underlying the novellas is an Ignatian or Jesuit artistic slant in which Cervantes illuminates what is good and beautiful and also what is dark and obscure, but in such a vivid way that the reader is mysteriously brought into the presence of the image in a multidimensional manner. It is the Ignatian illumination which permits the novellas to communicate to readers aesthetically and artistically that which is to be admired and imitated and that which is to be despised by the reader, without descending into preachy, ponderous narration as other novels of the epoch were prone to do. This thesis will reveal what is most striking about the novellas: the integration of the content and the form and style in such a way that they draw upon each other and become inseparable.",,,English
Dissertation,,2011,Journeying to God in Communion with the Other: A Comparative Theological Study of the Muslim and Catholic Pilgrimage Traditions in South Central Java and Their Contributions to the Catholic Theology of Communio Sanctorum,Massachusetts,Boston College,679,,9781267236111,,,,,Foreign Missions -- History -- Regional -- Religious History|Theology -- Interreligious Dialogue|Foreign Missions -- Spirituality -- Pilgrimage,Asia -- Indonesia -- Java -- South Central Java,,"This dissertation is a comparative phenomenological and theological analysis on Catholic and Muslim traditions of pilgrimage to sacred tombs and shrines in south central Java, Indonesia. Both in the Muslim and Christian traditions, pilgrimage is a rich and complex religious practice that has served as a privileged milieu in which pilgrims and their communities attempt to foster diverse kinds of communion with God and His spiritual company of saints and other sacred figures, including the founders and paradigmatic ancestors of the local community. Precisely due to its richness and complexity as a spiritual and religio-cultural practice driven by the deeper and inclusive dynamics of communion, pilgrimage has also become a crucial practice in which a distinctive and hybrid religio-cultural identity is forged and negotiated in creative and fruitful ways—among others through the process of engaging various forms of otherness including other religious traditions and cultures—in the context of a long historical continuum that is also marked by tensions and ambiguities. Based on the underlying and multifaceted category of communion with God, the self, and the other that lies at the heart of the pilgrimage traditions in Islam and Catholicism, and guided by the method of the new comparative theology, this study attempts to offer a focused analysis of the major ways in which this dynamic of communion is played out in the deeper shared features and intimate encounters that exist between these two pilgrimage traditions in south central Java. Carried out from the perspective of the Catholic tradition, this study also seeks to explore the ways in which the extraordinary depth and breadth of these dynamics of communion in the Muslim and Catholic pilgrimage traditions—that in Catholic theology can be placed under the inclusive category of the work of the Spirit (pneumatology)—can serve as a creative avenue for a comparative theological enrichment of our contemporary understanding of the Catholic doctrine and practice of communio sanctorum (""communion of saints and the holy""). Drawing from both the most salient features of both the Muslim and Catholic pilgrimage practices in south central Java as well as the corresponding insights from the larger Islamic and Catholic traditions, this proposed pneumatological framework for a renewed understanding of the Catholic theology of communio sanctorum can be seen as the modest constructive fruit of this study's comparative theological engagement with the dynamics of pilgrimage in these two traditions. Through this process, the Catholic theology and practice of communio sanctorum is also made more richly anchored in the Catholic principles of communion, mediation, and sacramentality. And since this very process includes other religious tradition(s), the Catholic doctrine of communio sanctorum becomes remarkably inclusive and expansive as well, thus becoming a profoundly ""catholic"" theological vision.",,,English

Il s'agit de voir comment et pour quelles raisons les femmes, et en particulier leur corps, sont l'objet d'une disciplinarisation sociale qui abouti à une redéfinition et à une codification précise de la féminité à partir de la Réforme et de la confessionnalisation des sociétés. Cette thèse se concentre sur des ouvrages normatifs écrits par des théologiens, des pasteurs protestants et des prêtres jésuites abordant des thèmes aussi variées que l'éducation, le mariage, la maternité, le veuvage, ainsi que des textes législatifs touchant à tous les domaines de la vie quotidienne et des traités médicaux pour tenter de mettre au jour les mécanismes de ce phénomène de discipline du corps féminin en mettant en avant une perspective interconfessionnelle. Il s'agit de comprendre comment les gestes, le maintien, l'apparence et la sexualité ainsi que le langage sont contrôlés et maîtrisés pour former un habitus spécifique. Outre les normes que sous-tendent ces textes, certaines pratiques qui entourent le corps féminin sont étudiées à partir de lettres, mémoires et procès-verbaux. Ce travail propose donc de croiser les perspectives d'histoire sociale et d'histoire des femmes, d'histoire culturelle et d'anthropologie historique tout en effectuant une comparaison interconfessionnelle.||This thesis is about the female population of the Holy Roman Empire from about 1555, when the Peace of Augsburg, confirming the legitimacy of the Reformation was signed, until 1648, at the end of the Thirty Years' War. The purpose of this work is to see how and why women, and particularly their bodies, were targeted by social discipline, and how it generated a redefinition and a precise codification of femininity in the age of Reformation and the confessionalization of societies. This thesis focuses on normative books written by theologians, Protestant ministers and Jesuits, dealing with diverse subjects like education, marriage, maternity and widowhood. Laws and decrees about daily life have also been analysed, just like medical treaties revealing the mechanisms of the female body discipline in an interconfessional perspective. It shows how gestures, attitudes, appearance, sexuality and language were controlled in order to define a specific habitus. Beside the norms spread in the different documents under scrutiny, some practices related to the female body have been studied from letters, memoirs and statements of offence. This work crosses perspectives of social history, women and cultural history, as well as historical anthropology with an interconfessional comparison.",,,French

Their diverse insights reveal the historicity of sin in a remarkable way. They show not only that the universality of original sin is grounded upon the fact that sin happened at the beginning of human history, but also that the concrete historical effects of our decisions continue to have a deleterious influence upon the exercise of human freedom, such that all of our decisions are codetermined by a prior history of guilt and distorted desire. Sin truly has a history, and our concrete actions are the means by which this history makes progress toward our death and self-annihilation. At the same time, from within human history the truth of the Gospel struggles against the escalation of sin and works to bring human history out of the meaninglessness of evil and toward realizing and revealing the deeper meaning of the world in view of the eschatological future.|Rather than reducing the truth of original sin to a simple formula, we proceed by showing the complex and profound interrelation of several different theological aspects. Guided by Rahner and Girard and in conversation with contemporary viewpoints, we explore issues of human evolution, history, freedom, desire, and the ways in which society and culture incline us toward sin. We then constructively expand upon these ideas. Linking Rahner’s theology with Girard’s apocalyptic perspective, we illustrate the ways in which sin continues to make progress in our world: by infiltrating and distorting our naturally-good desires, aesthetic systems, societal institutions, and even our very biological nature.|These reflections are ultimately directed toward combining a deeper appreciation of divine grace with a revitalized Christian ethic of striving toward justice even in the face of escalating violence. By our actions for a better world, we hope for the transcendent and apocalyptic victory of divine love over original sin.",,,English
Dissertation,"Ackerman, Robert Steven",2007,Genetic Engineering: A Fundamental Moral Approach,New York,Fordham University,269,PhD diss.,,,http://fordham.bepress.com/dissertations/AAI3255036,,20th century|21st century,Theology -- Moral|Sciences -- Genetics -- Controversies,,"Rahner, Karl, 1904–1984","This dissertation contends that the fundamental moral themes of the relationship between nature and person and the relationship between faith and reason can be used to retrieve a natural law approach that adequately addresses the weaknesses of two models of creation, the stewardship position and the created co-creator position, that have been used to assess the limits and possibilities of genetic engineering in human beings. This revised natural law approach, in turn, specifies a third model of creation that I have termed ""limited co-creator."" As a corrective to these earlier models, the limited co-creator model steers a course between the extremes of a stewardship position that severely restricts genetic manipulation and a created co-creator position that some advocates have used to justify unlimited genetic manipulation.|Relying on the insights of such theologians as Karl Rahner, Wilhem Korff, and Franz Böckle, this investigation argues that a retrieved natural law position is grounded by a properly construed relationship between nature and person where nature is foundational to person and person functions as the sufficient criterion for the universality of moral judgment. It also argues that this properly construed relationship between nature and person presupposes a theological horizon that inspires reason and is further specified by it. Klaus Demmer's anthropological implications of faith are used in this study to guide moral reason in its assessment of the four types of genetic engineering potentially available to human beings, including somatic cell therapy, germ-line gene therapy, enhancement somatic engineering, and germ-line enhancement, prior to going down the clinical path. The limited co-creator model that is specified by this approach avoids a naturalism that makes nature normative, a naïve rationalism that rejects the insights of faith, and an isolating fideism that marginalizes reason by making the insights of faith impervious to analysis.",,,English

Formé auprès de Charles Le Brun à la Manufacture royale des Gobelins, il y rencontre Jean-Baptiste Colbert qui devient son premier mécène. Protégé par ce dernier qui l’envoie en Italie, Théodon rejoint en 1677 l’Académie de France à Rome où il sculpte pour Louis XIV et le château de Versailles. Parallèlement il prend part à la vie académique romaine. Membre actif de l’Accademia di San Luca et de la congrégation des Virtuosi al Pantheon, Théodon devient l’un des sculpteurs les plus recherchés de la Rome de la fin du Seicento, sollicité par les papes Innocent XII et Clément XI à Saint-Pierre de Rome et au Latran, et par les congrégations et les ordres religieux au Gesù et au Monte di Pietà. Appelé par Louis XIV, il revient à Paris en 1705 et contribue, durant ses dernières années, à la décoration des Maison royales de Marly et de Meudon. Abordant avec brio l’allégorie et la sculpture animalière pour Colbert, la mythologie et le genre historique pour Louis XIV, la sculpture funéraire et l’art du portrait pour Christine de Suède, le sculpteur s’illustre avant tout dans l’art religieux. Brillante personnalité artistique du XVIIe siècle, Théodon méritait une étude. Nous avons considéré sa vie et sa carrière, analysé sa manière et établi le corpus exhaustif de son œuvre.| |Jean-Baptiste Théodon (1645–1713) was a French sculptor of the reign of Louis XIV who belonged both to the French and Italian schools of sculpture of the Seventeenth-Century. In the 1670’s during his training at the ‘Manufacture des Gobelins’ he worked under the supervision of Charles Le Brun and met the minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert. In 1677 he joined the French Academy in Rome where he carved garden sculptures for royal estates and for his protector Colbert. Early in his Roman carrier he was made member of the Academy of St Luke and member of the Congregazione dei Virtuosi al Pantheon where he met Bernini, the architect Carlo Fontana and the painter Carlo Maratta. Appreciated by the Pope Innocent XII he obtained several commissions at Saint-Peter’s (Baptismal chapel, Monument to Christine of Sweden) and at the same time he worked for the Jesuits at the Sant’Ignazio chapel at the Gesù. As one of the most significant sculptors of the end of the Roman Seicento he dedicated his last years in Rome to the pope Clement XI and the papal basilica before his return to Paris in 1705 where he worked for the Sun King and the ‘Maisons’ of Meudon and Marly. With the same maestria Jean-Baptiste Théodon carved allegories for Colbert, mythological and historical figures for Louis XIV, funeral sculptures and portrait for Christine of Sweden as well as works of art for Roman churches. The Ph.D. dissertation consists of a study of the career of the sculptor with an analysis of his artistic manner and its evolution from Paris to Rome. In addition the thesis includes the complete ‘catalogue raisonné’ of his works, sculptures and drawings.",Titre provenant de l'écran-titre. - Thèse confidentielle jusqu'au 05 décembre 2013,,French
Dissertation,"Adamson, Christopher",2014,'Sorrow's springs are the same': Synoeciosis in the Poetry of Alfred Tennyson and Gerard Manley Hopkins,"Corvallis, OR",Oregon State University,,PhD diss.,,,http://hdl.handle.net/1957/49274,,,Literature -- Poetry -- Theory|Theology -- Christology,,"Hopkins, Gerard Manley, 1844–1889","Tennyson and Hopkins scholarship is dominated by a focus on antithetical dichotomies. Tennyson's speakers are fractured selves focused on the gap between matter and spirit, faith and reason, solitude and community. Likewise, Hopkins' doubled vocation as priest and poet is presented as a contradiction to the point that the transition from his early nature sonnets to his later terrible sonnets is seen as analogous of that conflict. However, both poets tend to represent contraries through the figure of synoeciosis rather than antithesis. Synoeciosis is the coupling of two contraries without the intention to oppose them. Rather than being a contradiction for its own sake, synoeciosis serves to illuminate a hidden truth, much like its parent figure, paradox. In this thesis, the poetry of Tennyson and Hopkins are read through the hermeneutic of synoeciosis, with the purpose of moving beyond dialectical thinking. Following Hopkins' writings on mystery and Giorgio Agamben's presentation of the influence of Messianic time on poetry, this thesis proposes that the Incarnation, as the coupling of the divine and human natures of Christ, is the pattern that influences all forms of doubling for these poets.",,,English
Dissertation,"Agmon, Danna",2011,"An Uneasy Alliance: Traders, Missionaries, and Tamil Intermediaries in Eighteenth-century French India","Ann Arbor, MI",University of Michigan,,PhD diss.,,,http://hdl.handle.net/2027.42/89720,,18th century,Foreign Missions -- Trade,Asia -- India|Europe -- France,,"This dissertation examines the fraught intersection of commerce and conversion in the eighteenth-century French empire in India. I analyze the profound conflicts between the state-sponsored French projects of trade and religion in the colony of Pondichéry in South India, and by doing so reveal the many internal contradictions that posed a challenge to French aspirations for colonial hegemony. This thesis is equally concerned with the roles filled by Tamil professional intermediaries, employed by French traders and missionaries alike. By juxtaposing an analysis of internal French struggles with a study of colonial go-betweens, the thesis reveals the inherent incompleteness of colonial authority. It thus contributes to our understanding of early modern empires, by suggesting that fluidly distributed and tenuously held authority are the hallmarks of such ventures. Scholars have studied early modern commercial and religious projects, but rarely in tandem. My project examines the relationship between these two efforts, and reveals that while traders of the French Compagnie des Indes and Catholic missionaries were both sent to India to advance the interests of the French Crown, agents of these groups were deeply divided about the goals and practice of empire. I argue that while traders sought to sustain the profitable status quo and insert themselves into long-standing Indian Ocean trading networks based on kinship and confession, French missionaries, and particularly the Jesuits, espoused an ideology of disruption and radical change, in an effort to reconfigure the local spiritual and social hierarchies. As a result of these fissures among the French, Tamil commercial brokers and religious interpreters were able find a central and influential place in the conflicted crevices of the French project. While recent scholarly focus on colonial mediation has studied interactions between colonizers and colonized, this project demonstrates that a study of the lives and labors of local intermediaries also sheds lights on the internal contestations which shaped the French imperial endeavor. By examining the global project of empire through a resolutely local lens, I show that the colonizing experience is not one that simply divides colonizer and colonized, but rather creates fractures within imperial institutions and among colonizing agents.",,,English

O objetivo é compreender como foi sendo construída esta disciplina, quais os fatores que influenciaram essa construção e, a partir deste estudo, num lócus específico, estabelecer relações com a construção social dessa disciplina no Brasil naquele período. A metodologia empregada foi a da pesquisa histórica, tendo como pressuposto a compreensão ampliada da noção de documento. As fontes analisadas foram livros didáticos e artigos escritos pelos padres/professores, relatórios do Ginásio, jornais de circulação da época, documentos oficiais, bem como foram realizadas entrevistas com ex-alunos que estudaram no Ginásio naquele período. A fundamentação teórica a partir da qual esta pesquisa foi estruturada baseia-se nos estudos sobre História das Disciplinas Escolares (HDE), especialmente nos trabalhos de Ivor Goodson. Algumas das contribuições desta pesquisa consistem em fazer emergir questões pouco exploradas na historiografia da Educação brasileira, como a mudança ocorrida na formação dos jesuítas no final do século XIX, a qual se refletiu na construção das disciplinas da área das Ciências Físicas e Biológicas no período anterior à década de cinqüenta do século XX, na região sul do Brasil. No entanto, a questão fundamental que perpassa todo este trabalho consiste na discussão sobre a relação entre os objetivos do ensino secundário propostos no currículo oficial e a pouca relevância social que caracterizava (ou ainda caracteriza) a disciplina escolar Química no currículo real do ensino secundário brasileiro.||The purpose in this research is to build the history of the school discipline chemistry in a secondary teaching institution, in the period 1909 to 1942. The search is to understand how this discipline was being constructed, which factors influenced this construction and, by the study in a specific locus, establish connections with the social construction of this discipline in Brazil, at that period. The methodology applied was historical research, having as purpose, the amplified comprehension of document notion. The sources analyzed were didactic books and articles written by priest/professors, Secondary school reports, newspapers from that period and official documents. Interviews were realized with ex-students who took Secondary education at that period in that School. The theoretical basis supporting this research was structured on the history of School Disciplines, especially on Ivor Goodsons works. Some of these contributions consisted in bringing into view questions not much explored in Brazilian education historiography, like the change in the Jesuits formation at the end of XIX century, which reflected on the construction of the disciplines of the area of Physics and Biology Sciences in the period before the decade of the 50 s in the XX century, in the South region of Brazil. However, the main question in this work consists in a discussion about the connection between the objectives of secondary education proposed in the formal curriculum and the small social relevance that characterized (or still characterizes) the Chemistry School discipline on the real curriculum of Brazilian Secondary education.",,,Portuguese

O período de transição da educação no Brasil colônia foi enfocado a partir de dois métodos norteadores das diretrizes conceituais e educacionais, são eles: o Ratio studiorum, da educação jesuíta e O Verdadeiro Método de Estudar de Verney, da educação laica. Fundada por Inácio de Loyola, em 1534, a Companhia de Jesus estabeleceu prioridades pedagógicas basicamente voltadas à educação de novas gerações e à ação missionária de difusão dos valores religiosos, sendo que, nessas duas instâncias a música teve papel relevante na perspectiva da relação ensino-aprendizagem da educação religiosa. Verney, conforme relata a historiografia, teve um papel central para compreensão do movimento iluminista português, norteador da reforma pombalina, pois através de sua obra, mobilizou novos rumos para educação de Portugal e suas colônias, compatíveis com o pensamento vigente na Europa do século XVIII. Com a reforma pombalina a música foi minimizada no ambiente escolar, ocupando outros espaços e criando estilos diferenciados, tanto no que diz respeito à produção musical sacra quanto à profana. O Brasil Colônia obteve representatividade musical na Europa, pela qualidade de seus músicos-compositores mulatos, em especial os de Minas Gerais, Bahia, Pernambuco e sacros em Mogi das Cruzes.||This thesis proposes reading music as a resource for teaching, from the analysis of the methodological clash between the Jesuit Education and the Pombal Education, immediately following the educational reform proposed by the Marquis of Pombal. The educational transition in Colonial Brazil was focused on two guiding methods of conceptual and educational guidelines, they are: the Jesuit Ratio studiorum and Verney's True Method of Studying, of secular education. Founded by Ignatius of Loyola in 1534, the Society of Jesus establishes educational priorities primarily focused on education of new generations and the missionary work of infusing religious values, being that in these two instances music has played a significant role in the perspective in teaching or having a religious education. Verney, as reported by historians, played a central role in understanding Portuguese Age of Enlightenment, leading the reform of Pombal, because it was with his work that new directions for education were mobilized in Portugal and its colonies, befitting of the prevailing thought in eighteenth-century Europe. With the Pombal Reform the music was oppressed in school environments, occupying other spaces and creating differentiated styles, with regard to music production being sacred as well as profane.

Although Baciccio's ceiling paintings for the church have been the subject of many scholarly publications, these frescoes only represent a small portion of the artist's extensive and diverse oeuvre. During his lifetime, Baciccio was best known as a portraitist, as he worked consistently in the genre throughout his artistic career, producing the likenesses of seven popes, numerous cardinals, and other figures of note. Celebrated for their ability to capture both the sitters' physical and psychological characteristics, Baciccio's portraits reveal a strong stylistic affinity with those of his mentor, Gian Lorenzo Bernini, which calls his perceived individuality as an artist into question. In this examination, it is held that Baciccio's professional relationship with Bernini allowed for many of the popular stylistic characteristics of Bernini's work, particularly those of his sculpted portraiture, to be imparted on the manner of the younger Genoese artist. It is also maintained that Baciccio's financial success undoubtedly hinged on his close affiliation with Bernini, who orchestrated numerous commissions for his protégé. In addition to the deft translation of his mentor's sculpted style into the medium of painting, Baciccio experimented with the styles of other successful artists, such as Rubens, Van Dyck, Rembrandt, Velázquez, Maratti, and Poussin, among others. The motives for the arguably deliberate emulation of these artists' styles are also weighed in the present study. It is ultimately determined that Baciccio's high productivity, willingness to execute works falling under the rubric of ""minor arts,"" demonstrable reuse of popular compositions, businesslike approach to producing preparatory sketches, and experimentation with different aesthetics, all support the notion that Baciccio intentionally cultivated a derivative artistic identity, which was likely fueled by an unwavering zeal for recognition and monetary success.",,,English

Bush administration, American involvement in El Salvador's civil war, one of the last Cold War battlegrounds, had disappeared from the foreign policy agenda. However, two events in November 1989 shattered the bipartisan consensus on US policy toward El Salvador: the failure of the FMLN's largest military offensive of the war and the murder of six Jesuit priests, their housekeeper, and her daughter by the Salvadoran military, the FAES. Despite more than one billion dollars in US military assistance, the war had stalemated, promoting both sides to seek a negotiated political settlement mediated by the United Nations. The Jesuit murders demonstrated the failure of the policy of promoting respect for democracy and human rights and revived the debate in Congress over US aid to El Salvador. This thesis argues that the Bush administration sought to remove the burden of El Salvador from its foreign policy agenda by actively pushing for the investigation and prosecution of the Jesuit case and fully supporting the UN-mediated peace process. Using recently declassified government documents from the George Bush Presidential Library, this thesis will examine how the Bush administration fundamentally changed US policy toward El Salvador. Administration officials carried out an unprecedented campaign to pressure the FAES to investigate the Jesuit murders and bring the killers to justice while simultaneously attempting to prevent Congress from cutting American military assistance. The Bush administration changed the objective of its El Salvador policy from military victory over the guerrillas to a negotiated political settlement. The US facilitated the peace process by pressuring the Salvadoran government and the FMLN to negotiate in good faith and accept compromises. When both sides signed a comprehensive peace agreement on January 16, 1992, the burden of El Salvador was lifted.",,,English

The first phase used a researcher-designed survey in two versions: The Presidents' Jesuit Education and Leadership Survey and the Administration and Faculty Jesuit Education and Leadership Survey. The second phase considered a group of interviews using a standardized open-ended interview guide in two versions: The Jesuit University Presidents Interview Guide and the Jesuit Administrative and Faculty Interview Guide.

Father António Vieira’s arrival, in 1653, at the strategically important colony of Maranhão and Grão-Pará only stirred up the quarrel because the settlers and the civil authorities claimed the Indians as servile labour force, specially as rowers and pickers of rain forest products. After a period of uncertainty, Father Jean-Philippe Bettendorff obtained, in 1686, the promulgation of a law that defined the working conditions of the Indian neophytes and gave a large autonomy to the aldeamentos.

L'analyse de ces sources, en grande partie inédites - rapports des missionnaires jésuites, actes de l'Inquisition, synodes, pregoni, pragmatiques, actes du Parlement, registres des douanes, actes notariés et fonds paroissiaux - a permis d'abandonner la vision univoque d'une minorité irréductible, persécutée sans trêve et marginale. En particulier, nous avons analysé les relations qui liaient, entre eux et avec les autres populations, les groupes tsiganes sardes, et montré comment leurs relations avec les institutions insulaires étaient articulées et se développaient à différents niveaux, non seulement doctrinal et répressif mais aussi économique et social. Nous avons souligné l'importance des évènements rituels qui scandaient leur vie religieuse, et constituaient un formidable dispositif de construction symbolique qui cimentait l'appartenance des tsiganes à la communauté locale, à travers un vaste réseau de relations, échanges, alliances. Nous avons enfin mis en évidence, grâce à la comparaison avec des documents provenant d'autres territoires, le fait que le processus d'implantation des populations tsiganes en Sardaigne se liait à un processus plus général qui concerne toute la Méditerranée, et que la circulation des groupes n'avait pas toujours un caractère diasporique mais faisait partie de stratégies de mobilité diversifiées.

Studying these sources allows us to move beyond the reductive vision of the Gypsies as an indomitable minority that was relentlessly persecuted and marginal. In particular, we have analyzed the social relations of Sardinian Gypsy groups (both) among themselves and with the other residents, and we have highlighted how their relationship with the island institutions was articulated, and developed not only at a doctrinal and repressive level, but also economically and socially. We have highlighted the importance of ritual events wich marked their religious life, while being at the same time an important device in the symbolic construction that cemented the Gypsy's belonging to the local community through a vast network of relations, economic exchange and alliances. Finally, through a comparison with documents from other geographical areas, this thesis demonstrates that the process of settlement of Gypsy populations in Sardinia is linked to a process existing throughout the Mediterranean as a whole, and that the circulation of these groups did not always have a diaphoric character, but was part of a wider range of mobility strategies. Therefore, this thesis proposes a shift in the interpretative paradigm, in order to move beyond the limitations of many traditional reconstructions.",,,French

I then turn to Balthasar and examine his ""aesthetic Christology,"" through which he seeks to preserve the integrity of aesthetics for theology -- concentrating most obviously on the appearance of Christ -- while dealing sufficiently with the problem of evil and the reality of suffering. In my final chapter, I reframe my initial question to ask how our present perception of Christ in his earthly ministry relates us to the eschatological vision of God (the beatific vision). Specifically, I explore how our ""aesthetic appreciation"" of Christ's earthly ministry relates to our supernatural hope of seeing Christ in his fully glorified and exalted form, as suggested by John: ""Dear friends, now we are children of God, and what we will be has not yet been made known. But we know that when Christ appears, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is"" (1 John 3:2–3; NIV). I conclude by arguing that the difference Christ makes to our perception of beauty is this: Christ not only manifests the vision of God in our humanity but also actively mediates the eschatological vision of God, bringing us to that day when we shall see him as he is, and so enjoy the summit and source of all beauty ""face to face.""""--Abstract.",,,English

Focalizamos o trabalho missionário dos jesuítas, capuchinhos e oratorianos na elaboração de reduções religiosas principiadas a partir da segunda metade do século XVII. Selecionamos a cidade pombalina de Oeiras (PI) e as vilas de índios Monte - Mor o Novo da América (CE) e Crato (CE) como estudos de caso, no intuito de analisar a influência da pecuária, dos caminhos do gado, das determinações provenientes de Lisboa e do papel eclesiástico da igreja em seus traçados intraurbanos.||This dissertation analyzes the urbanization process in the Brazilian northeastern hinterland between the 17th and the 18th centuries as connected to the so called Curral de Reses (Cattle Corral) and Curral de Almas (Souls' Corral). Curral de Reses (Cattle Corral) investigates the several aspects of urbanization in the sugar-producing Northeast, relating it to the role of extensive cattle ranges in the process of population growth, to the land ownership and to the development of hamlets alongside the herding trails. The herds pushed from the coast, broke through the Brazilian northeasterner hinterland, creating hither, thither and yonder new pathways, therefore demystifying the unknown. Later in time, these trails were used by colonial and clerical authorities to start missionary settlements - ""Currais de Almas"" (Souls' Corrals)- that aimed at the material and spiritual welfare of the Church and the Order of Christ and the conversion of the native peoples. ""Curral de Almas"" investigates the activity of the Catholic Church associated to the portuguese government as the ""Tapuia "" native people and the itinerant cowboys (who ""bummed"" around the land) settled and congregated at first in missions and later in strategically located urban centers. Another focal point has been the investigation of the missionary work of Jesuit and Capuchin friars as well as ""The Congragation of the Oratory"" in the construction of religious settlements as early as the second half of the 17th century. The town of ""Oeiras"" (PI) -created by the Marquis of Pombal- and the Indian villages ""Monte-Mor o Novo da América"" (CE) and ""Crato""(CE) were selected as case studies, attempting to analyze the influence of cattle industry, herding trails, determinations from Lisbon and the church in the planning of the urban center.",,,Portuguese

In that century of Enlightenment, these events – known as transits of Venus – attracted massive interest from the entire world of learning. The monograph ""Maximilianus Hell (1720–1792) and the Eighteenth-Century Transits of Venus. A Study of Jesuit Science in Nordic and Central-European Contexts"" is a source-based, historical case study that aims to explore and contextualise Venus transit activities in the Nordic countries and Central Europe. It traces the scientific career of an individual, Maximilianus Hell, and analyses the conditions for astronomical research in areas presently known as Slovakia, Austria, Romania, Hungary, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland and Russia. It presents numerous primary sources and also has a separate part with editions of Latin texts. This is the first full-scale, contextualised study of the Jesuit Father Maximilianus Hell in the English language. New sources, not only on Father Hell, but also on the institutional history of astronomy in Central and Nordic regions of Europe are presented. The thesis is also pioneering in the sense that it covers areas that have until now been neglected or at least ill-understood in the Anglo- and Francophone historiography on the eighteenth-century transits of Venus. By ‘breaking down national barriers’ and employing a comparative perspective, it offers new insight into the different conditions for astronomical research in each country or region covered. Examination of archival sources and literature in various languages – primarily in Latin, Swedish, Danish, Russian, French and German – has been vital here. Hopefully, this study may prove helpful to the formation of a fuller and more nuanced understanding of the Venus transit projects of the eighteenth century, seen as an international enterprise.",,,English

Après cette première moitié du XVIIe siècle, l’œuvre comme son auteur tombèrent dans l’oubli et ne connurent pas de nouvelle publication. Ce n’est qu’à partir de la fin XIXe siècle que les critiques, notamment Henri Brémond commencèrent à s’intéresser à Richeome et à son travail, mais sans pour autant y consacrer un ouvrage ou une édition critique. Cette thèse se propose donc de redécouvrir un ouvrage religieux à part, oscillant entre le catéchisme, les méditations, le récit de pèlerinage et le roman d’aventures. Pour ce travail, nous avons choisi l’édition bordelaise de Simon Millanges de 1604 qui comporte quatorze illustrations. L’édition et l’analyse de ce texte et de ses images nous permettent de mieux comprendre les influences et les enjeux d’un ouvrage qui s’inscrit résolument dans le contexte religieux et politique du début du XVIIe siècle.||In 1604, the Jesuit Louis Richeome (1544–1625) published for the first time Le Pelerin de Lorete. The book was re-edited several times and was translated in three languages until 1628. Le Pelerin de Lorete was considered a best-seller for its time in France. Despite this initial success, the book remained unstudied until the late 19th century. Among the first literary critics to study Le Pelerin de Lorete was Henri Brémond (1865–1933). However, to date there is no critical edition of the book. Thus, this study proposes a new reading of Le Pelerin de Lorete as a religious book that oscillates between a catechism and a guide to spiritual meditation and between a pilgrimage account and an adventure novel. Moreover, by providing for the first time a visual and textual analysis of the book, we uncover the historical and religious context that made possible this unique piece.",,,French

In the Epic panels, Benton employed stylized black, white, and Indian bodies to challenge conventional accounts of American history and expectations for mural painting. With their strangely elongated bodies, exaggerated proportions, distorted physical features, and intensely sculptural presence, Benton's monumental figures are powerful formal inventions but also startlingly and unmistakably American. Benton sought to interrogate the nation's art and body politic visually and thematically at a moment when problems of racial and national identity dominated political and cultural discourse. Politically motivated, the Epic is integrally related to the racially charged citizenship debates of the late 1910s and early 1920s. Yet the specific histories, art histories, and cultural references embedded in the iconography of the murals and associated with its figures and forms have never been analyzed in their entirety, until now. Discovery, Palisades, Aggression, Prayer, Retribution, Clearing the Land, Planting, The Slaves, The Witch, The Pathfinder, Over the Mountain, Jesuits, Struggle for the Wilderness, Lost Hunting Ground: these are the titles of the fourteen publicly exhibited Epic panels. The titles hint at their content, but it is the black, white, and Indian figures that reveal Benton's re-thinking of American history and the role of race within it. The nation's most familiar historical themes--discovery, religion, westward expansion--are recast to confront the racial inequities and violence embedded in the popular experience of these histories. This dissertation examines the Epic's provocative elements, from the unheroic subject matter to Benton's treatment of form, space, and design, and their influence on the ""failure"" of the mural series; after almost a decade of work, Benton had not received a public commission and abandoned the project. Consequently, Benton's artistic methods, idiosyncratic stylistic borrowings, and ambiguous use of racial figures are considered in relation to his own ambitions for these works as well as to the Epic 's anomalous status within the history of American art.",,,English

F., 1904–1984","This work is grounded in a moral horizon constructed around the worldview of emergent probability as central to a generalized theory of evolution reaching finality in the Trinity, in Otto Friedman's transdisciplinary framework for professional practice transposed into the realm of the transcendent, in Bernard Lonergan's transdisciplinary method in Insight and Method , and in an analysis of core problems in contemporary society. All these elements, when used as a guide to an encounter with the incarnate meaning of Thomas Müntzer, make explicit the horizons and intentions of the author as they relate to different levels of conversion required for intelligent, reasonable and responsible action during times of fundamental institutional change. This study offers one concrete approach to objectifying such foundations, where the heuristic notion of an encounter with the meaning of another's life provides data for objectifying one's own foundations. This objectified intentionality can then be used to expand one's horizon and intentions or initiate a shift to a higher viewpoint. This work operates not at the level of common sense understanding but in the explanatory theoretical realm of meaning grounded in a working knowledge of the realm of interiority. My encounter partner is Thomas Müntzer, an early 16th century German reformer whose commitment to Church and God fills a grey area in my own scientific and policy-making background. Evaluating and extending my positions vis-Ã -vis Müntzer's foundations is the immediate task; knowing exactly how to do this is the general theme. The subject matter is neither MÃ¼ntzer nor the Reformation, although both are extensively researched, but my own foundational stance. The objective is not to work out a complete program, but to present and test one concrete procedure for intentionality analysis in the functional speciality of Foundations.",,,English

The emblem form has been considered from the perspective of individual author, geographical factors and theological background but there have been few comparative studies with respect to religious emblems. This study will compare Protestant and Catholic emblems produced during the Reformation and Counter- Reformation, drawing on specific examples from, in particular, France, but also Germany and England. Emblems played a huge role in early modern life. They expressed contemporary thought and also became part of the physical environment, being etched into stone, or wood, or sewn into cloth as decoration. In a period of such political, civil, and religious unrest, it would, therefore, seem likely that the Catholic and Protestant emblem would be quite distinct types either expressing theologically opposed notions, or manipulating the text/image relationship in quite different ways. Understanding how these emblems functioned, therefore, necessitates close reading, indeed, reading in the way the emblems were intended to be read. This study, therefore, will address the question of differences through detailed analysis of specific examples. This study begins with an introduction which gives a brief history of emblem literature and a review of relevant secondary material. Key terms and definitions regarding emblems are also explained here. This chapter also introduces the authors of the emblems analysed in later chapters. The first part of this thesis examines the emblem form in the wider context of the Reformation. From an initial overview of some of the key issues of the Reformation in chapter one, chapters two and three move on to analyse closely a wide corpus of Catholic and Protestant emblems. In these chapters the emblem is broken down into its component parts of verse and picture. Chapter two examines the religious emblem from the perspective of motif while chapter three approaches the emblem from a thematic angle. The second part of this study adopts a different approach presenting case studies of three authors. Chapter four explores the importance of the visual element in the emblems of Protestant author Rollenhagen. Chapter five investigates the Jesuit influences which shape the emblems of Catholic Berthod. While chapters four and five offer an insight into the work of prototypical Protestant and Catholic authors chapter six demonstrates the successful fusion of both Protestant and Catholic influences in the emblems of Wither. Indeed, this study suggests that the differences between Protestant and Catholic at this time are largely exaggerated with respect to emblems. Protestant and Catholic emblems are not, this study maintains, in essence all that different. It argues that, in fact, Protestant and Catholic emblems were often very close in terms of content and that the real difference is in the way they manipulate the text/image relationship.",,,English

Nous montrons que les pères jésuites s'appuient sur les productions littéraires de leurs écrivains profesionnels (scriptores liborum) et sur l'outil journalistique des ""Mémoiresé et du ""Dictionnaire universel"" de Trévoux pour concrétiser leur projet pédagogique d'investir les savoirs scientifiques et historique, afin de répondre aux difficultés rencontrées aves les propositions philosophiques nouvelles. Les jésuites s'attachent à définir plusieurs notions traitées par la physique (l'attraction, la matière, etc.), tout comme ils tentent de préciser la fonction des fables, de la mythologie antique et de justifier la grande ancienneté de la chronologie biblique face à la découverte des annales chinoises. en même temps, les pères abordent plusieurs questions fondées sur la notion de secret (pierre philosophale, cure magnétique, poudre de sympathie, baguette divinatoire, kabbale, prophéties, oracles, emblèmes, énigmes, etc.) qui, à ce titre, se rattachent aux thématiques ésotériques. S'il s'agit pour eux de susciter un débat propice au déploiement d'un discours rhétorique, plutôt que d'affronter directement les arguements adverses, ces derniers s'efforcent de récupérer telle ou telle thématique au gré des opportunités dans le but de l'utiliser pour justifier leurs propres idées, ce qui cache mal leur difficulté à bâtir une doctrine globale cohérente. Une stratégie ambigüe dont l'enjeu est double. D'une part, il est nécessaire d'apporter des réponses aux attaques protestantes qui cherchent à ruiner la crédibilité tant des Pères de l'Eglise que du dogme trinitaire et, partant, menacent lza tradition catholique. D'autre part, les jésuites doivent préserver les mystère cachés d'une nature créee par Dieu, au risque de soutenir des positions scientifiques obsolètes.||The object of this thesis is to look for the place of the esoteric themes in the strategy of Jesuits to carry out, in the animated context of the France in the turn of the XVIIIth century, their pastoral mission of defence of the catholic tradition, determinated at the council of Trent. We show that the Jesuit fathers lean on the literary productions of their professionnal writers (scriptores librorum) and th journalistic tool of the ""Mémoires"" and the ""Dictionnaire universel"" de Trévoux, to concretize their pedagogical project to invest the scientific and historical knowledges, to reply to the met difficulties coming up against the new philosophical propositions. The Jesuits attempt to define several notions discussed by the physics (attraction, matter, etc.), quite as they try o specify the function of the fables of the antique mythology and to prove the great antiquity of the biblical chronology facing the discovery of the chinese annals. At the same time, the fathers approach several questions based on the notion of secret (philosopher's stone, magnetic cure, powder with sympathy, divinatory baguette, cabala, propheties, oracles, emblems, enigmae), which as such are connected with the esoteric themes. On the one hand, it is necessary to answer to the Protestant criticisms who try to ruin the cridibility of the Fathers of the Church as Trinitarian Dogma, and, consequently, to threaten the catholic tradition. On the other hand, the Jesuits have to protect the hidden mysteries of a nature created by God, at the risk of support obsolete scientifical positions.",,,French

The beginning of this renewal is marked by the work of Karl Rahner who, before the Second Vatican Council, decried the fact that Roman Catholicism, in contrast to the Protestant theological tradition, lacked an adequate theology of the word. Relying on a Roman Catholic theology of grace, Rahner's work, along with that of sacramental theologian Louis-Marie Chauvet, demonstrates the Roman Catholic conviction that the word is fundamentally sacramental: it has the capacity to bear God's presence to humanity.|This dissertation examines the contributions of Rahner and Chauvet, contextualizing them within the larger Christian tradition, and identifying ways in which their contributions advanced a Roman Catholic theology of the word. To that end, the first chapter describes the twentieth-century context. The second chapter treats classical sacramental theology: the work of Augustine and Thomas Aquinas. Here words are identified as types of signs, and similarities between classical approaches to God's revelation found in scripture and in the sacraments are demonstrated. The third chapter considers the work of Reformation theologians Martin Luther and John Calvin. These figures emphasize that the scriptural word is also the sacramental word of promise; they grapple with the necessity of material elements to mediate God's grace in a fallen world. The fourth chapter examines Rahner's efforts to demonstrate the relationship between word and sacrament by contextualizing them within an understanding of an already graced world in which language is the privileged place of the self-expression of God. The fifth chapter examines Chauvet's work, focusing on the sacramentality of language, culture, and creation, yet emphasizing the radical absence of the body of the Risen Christ. Christians are formed by the word into the body of Christ through participation in liturgy and maintenance of a sacramental world. The conclusion compares these approaches, and analyzes their implications for Trinitarian theology, sacramentality, and the understanding of the relationship between word and sacrament. It suggests that the principle of sacramentality is a necessary consideration for Roman Catholic theologies of the word.",,,English

Thus, he creates a prose work that ministered to Catholic souls, appealed to Protestant audiences, and initiated the literature of tears in England. Southwell readapts the traditional image of Mary Magdalene for a Catholic Early Modern audience by utilizing the techniques of Jesuit meditation, which later flourished in the weeper texts of Richard Crashaw and George Herbert. His vividly imagined scenes also employ the Petrarchan and Ovidian language of longing and absence and coincide with both traditional and mystic early church writers such as Bernard and Augustine. Through this combination, Southwell’s Marie Magdalens Funeral Teares resonated with Catholics deprived of both ministry and the presence of Christ in the Eucharist.

Chegaram poucos anos após os comerciantes portugueses, mas não ficaram sob sua proteção. Ao contrário destes, não ficaram apenas nas cidades portuárias, mas adentraram-se no território japonês que passava por um século de sangrentas guerras, num longo processo de unificação do território por um poder central, que só terminaria no século seguinte. Os jesuítas, ordem que manteve o monopólio da evangelização do Japão até o ano de 1593, acabaram por se envolver no complexo jogo político de então, à procura de patronos e proteção para que pudessem espalhar o Evangelho dentre a população nativa. Sem qualquer proteção garantida a maneira que encontraram para cristianizar os japoneses foi implicarem-se na política local tentando convencê-los de que o cristianismo era a verdadeira religião. A forma como se deveria dar esse processo de convencimento não foi, contudo, consenso entre os jesuítas, que acabaram se dividindo acerca do melhor método. Se de um lado o Visitador Geral das Índias Orientais, Alexandre Valignano, formulou um método inovador, denominado pelo próprio como acomodação (ou accomodattio em italiano), uma outra parcela da ordem, encabeçada pelo segundo superior da missão japonesa, Francisco Cabral, discordava, afirmando que o processo de evangelização deveria sempre priorizar os regramentos da Ordem para não correr o perigo de extraviar a mensagem. O objetivo da presente dissertação é, portanto, mapear e compreender essas duas diferentes estratégias de evangelização, tanto para a missão para a qual foi criada, no Japão, quanto para os seus agentes, os jesuítas.||In 1549, the first Christian missionaries arrived in Japan to evangelize the natives. They arrived some yearsafter the Portuguese traders, but did not stay under their protection. On the contrary, the missionaries entered the Japanese territory by their selves, while the traders stayed only in the port cities. At that time Japan was emerged in many civil wars in a period called Sengoku Jidai (the country at war). The Jesuits the denomination that hold the monopoly of the Japanese mission until 1593 saw their selves involved in a complicated political plot. As they could not count on any secular protection, they chose to look for the warlords (daimy) protection to accomplish the evangelization of the Japanese people. The only way for that was the convincement of the people that Christianity was the true religion. Nevertheless, even among the Jesuits that went to the Japanese mission, there was not a consensus about the best way to convince the Japanese to become Christians. The Visitor of the Jesuits missions in Asia, Alexandre Valignano, designed a new method called accomodatio, but some Jesuits were against it. Led by the second Superior of the Japanese mission, Francisco Cabral, they claimed that accomodatio was not the best way once it could mislead the neophytes. What they should do, in Cabrals point of view, was to follow strictly the rules of the Society of Jesus.

In other words, this research study proposed to provide a group of students with a space and opportunity for a 'calling to attend' experience of God; that is, an experience that was compelling. The theoretical framework called on two types of concepts: first, those related to the theological investigation of revelation and its connection with the aesthetic and religious experience; and secondly, those developed from current educational research and research into Religious Education paradigms. The development of this research study therefore: established the context within which the study was situated; discussed a theological framework from Hans Urs von Balthasar and its links with this research study; examined the theory of Bernard Lonergan that art was a carrier of meaning for religious experience; discussed the role of revelation, aesthetic and religious experience and the religious imagination located within the 'graced nature' concept of Catholic theology; and sought to determine the contribution such a learning experience could make to the religious development of post-compulsory students in a boys' senior secondary college. This study operated within a constructivist paradigm using case study and qualitative research methods. A focus group provided the research instrument for data gathering and included: participant observation; field notes; focus group discussions; and transcript analysis of the taped conversations of participants. The findings of this research study provided direction for further research and practice in post-compulsory religious education classroom program.",,,English

La présente démarche vise à comprendre les appropriations de l’écrit, la pluralité de ses interprétations et de ses usages. A Lyon, au XVIIe siècle, période considérée comme celle de l’entrée dans l’écrit (accroissement de l’enregistrement et du contrôle, inflation paperassière, constitution d’archives par les institutions), quels sont les usages de l'écrit, de quels statuts symboliques est-il investi ? L’accès croissant des individus à l’écrit, qu’il faut analyser précisément (temps, lieux, logiques de la diffusion selon les formes écrites) induit des changements, que l’on peut suivre selon trois perspectives. Inscrit dans un lieu, l’écrit a d’abord des effets sur l’appréhension de l’espace, que ce soit l’espace graphique, l’espace de l’édifice où il est inséré, de l’objet qui le supporte, ou l’espace de la ville. Il transforme ensuite les modalités des échanges marchands en s’imposant dans les transactions économiques les plus courantes, qui contribuent à familiariser la population urbaine avec son maniement. Il est enfin au cœur de la constitution d’une culture, culture de groupe ou d’individu, et des phénomènes identitaires qui l’accompagnent. Ces trois axes privilégient chaque fois des formes écrites différentes, pour certaines ancrées dans des traditions bibliographiques, écrits exposés, papiers, livres et ego-documents, correspondant aux modalités de leur appréhension (exposition, circulation, conservation).||This thesis attempts to approach the relationships between an urban population and literacy at a time characterised by an increase of writings and a resort even more important to writings (development of scribal proofs in justice, ""bureaucratization"", constitution of public archives). The gap between the capacity of reading and writing (which concerns a few persons) and the writing forms' expansion is the key of our investigation. In the seventeenth century, in the big town of Lyon, there are many ways to measure the inflation of writings and to understand their appropriations. First, we try to see how epitaphs, house names, shop signs, permanent and temporary inscriptions are surrounding the city, how the institutions (and principally the Municipality) product rules and resort to literate men like Jesuits to mark their names on Lyon's walls and buildings and to catch the power of the urban signs and doing so, how they contribute to create a public sphere. Then, we examine the question of the usual writings, contracts, receipts, economic and judiciary documents, which the common population is compelled to deal with. The trials of thefts of papers and of false documents inform about the appearance of a scribal proof's economy. At least, we question the social and cultural identity's build-up by the possession of printed books and by the act of writing (""ego-documents"").",,,French

The contribution of this dissertation is to show how the fullest readings of Spenser's representations of Christianity must take into account the interplay between Protestant and Catholic semiotic values. Spenser reclaims some of the outward forms associated with Catholicism and invests them with inwardly Protestant significations to present them as inclusively, merely Christian. In Chapters One and Two I examine the effect of the controversies between Protestants and Catholics on Spenser's rhetorical strategies in his addresses to Lord Burghley, Queen Elizabeth, the Earl of Essex, and other dedicatees of The Faerie Queene. I compare Spenser's strategies with those of Jesuit Robert Persons, zealous Protestant George Gifford, and John Donne in his Pseudo-Martyr. In Chapter Three I argue that Spenser sets into play a dialectic between the competing values of the Protestant and Catholic camps in order to synthesize them. Spenser asks the reader to consider Catholic values from the Protestant perspective, and vice versa, in his depictions of the House of Holiness, St. George, and Arthur, in his representations of sacraments, in the dialogues of the February, May, and July eclogues of The Shepheardes Calender, and in his discussions of religion in Mother Hubberds Tale and A View of the Present State of Ireland. In Chapter Four I look at the analogies between the heated debates over how to interpret the Eucharist and Spenser's continual problematizing of how to read his poetic signs. The debate between Thomas Cranmer and Stephen Gardiner over the Eucharist guides my discussion, as does George Gifford's Dialogue between a Papist and a Protestant (1582). The work of Ferdinand de Saussure and Mikhail Bakhtin particularly influences my approach to semiotics. In Chapter Five I examine the relation between Spenser's figures of the mons",,,English

First, we will take a close look at Maurice Duplessis et son temps, the story of a king-like figure recounted in an admiring fashion, written by royalist historian and Charles Maurras disciple Robert Rumilly. Secondly, we will examine Duplessis, the great epic tale of an illustrious conservative’s battles, written by conservative businessman and historian Conrad Black. Lastly, we will analyse Duplessis, the TV drama written by Denys Arcand, a disciple of Quebec nationalist historian Maurice Séguin, presenting Maurice Duplessis as the tragic incarnation of the French-Canadian nation, cynical yet conscious of his people’s impossible historical and political destiny. To complete the analysis, this thesis will also rely on Paul Ricoeur’s theory on narrative identity, notably discussed in Oneself as Another, Time and Narrative and Memory, History, Forgetting, as well as Michel de Certeau’s theory on writing and narrativization of history in The Writing of History.

Because Kircher covered the broadest range of musical topics and because he gained a worldwide readership, his work is especially useful in assessing learned inquiry into music during the seventeenth century. Clerics and courtiers like Kircher dominated the field, and their interests often diverged from those of composers and performers. In Kircher's time, learned musical researches were pursued in conjunction with others into mathematical and antiquarian matters. The nature and depth of Kircher's religious and institutional commitments were an important factor in distinguishing his musical studies from those of his contemporaries. The first chapter places Kircher in context and examines the genesis and early reception of Musurgia . Three subsequent chapters explore historical, theological, and scientific themes within his work. Kircher's researches into music history addressed contemporary debates over the merits of older music. In contrast to the humanist historiographical models adopted by most contemporary writers, Kircher traced music history according to the outlines of sacred history. Although his conclusions are now considered unreliable, they were widely discussed and debated as late as the 1770s. As with his historical views. Kircher's aesthetic theories were influenced by Jesuit liturgical and devotional practices. His music-technical language united theological and physical concepts that were themselves increasingly subject to scientific scrutiny. Kircher's researches into musical science rested upon the traditional understanding of music as a form of abstract mathematical knowledge, closely related to astronomy. Nevertheless, he attended to actual musical practice more closely than had earlier Jesuit mathematicians, and his treatment of musica mundana can be seen as having influenced the gradual separation of music from the quantitative disciplines of the quadrivium. Kircher's scientific practice, which emphasized wonders, prodigies, and spectacle, offers insight into seventeenth-century musical connoisseurship. The final chapter traces the fate of Musurgia , which remained a central work in its field for over a century. Patterns of readership changed as music came increasingly to be regarded as more an art than a science--a development to which Kircher himself contributed.",,,English

F., 1904–1984","A wealth of recent scholarship has focused on interreligious dialogue as a resource for the transformation of religious conflicts. Such studies often mention the importance of discoveries or 'insights' as key factors in successful dialogue processes. However, few authors have devoted sustained attention to understanding how insights contribute to transforming conflict dynamics during interfaith dialogues. The present study draws on the cognitional theory of Canadian philosopher Bernard Lonergan as a framework for exploring the significance of insights in interreligious dialogue processes. The study begins with an overview of representative perspectives on learning in interfaith dialogue and conflict transformation. Following this, I offer a detailed analysis of Lonergan's work on insight in understanding, judgment, and practical learning, highlighting the important role that insights play in structuring interpretation and communication in dialogue situations. Drawing on Lonergan's theoretical framework, I explore how insights are implicated in shaping communication in dialogues between religious actors, both in the development of conflicts, as well as in their transformation. Using case studies from dialogues involving Christians, Muslims, and Jews, I examine how mistaken insights can contribute to sustaining relationships of threat among parties in religious conflicts. I then examine how dialogue processes can act as catalysts for the emergence of new and more accurate insights that transform parties' understanding of the conflict. By helping parties correct mistaken interpretations and discover alternate ways of communicating, such insights can often play an important role in facilitating shifts from hostile patterns of interaction to more cooperative forms of engagement. Throughout, I explain how Lonergan's work offers significant advances over existing discussions of insight and its role in conflict transformation processes. His approach identifies a range of different types of insights, and thus facilitates an analysis of the different roles insights can play in structuring communication at different phases of dialogue processes. It also permits a more developed exploration of the various cognitional and environmental conditions that facilitate or frustrate the occurrence of insights in dialogue situations. His work thus constitutes an important resource for theorists and practitioners seeking a better understanding of the cognitive dynamics that contribute to the transformation of interreligious dialogue processes.",,,English

The present work of comparative theology explores the body and divinization in Jesuit Pierre Teilhard de Chardin (1881–1955) and Daoist Xiao Yingsou (fl. Song Dynasty 960–1278). Early in his writing, Teilhard loses interest in discovering the theological significance of the human body in favor of addressing the fulfillment of the Cosmic Body of Christ. Accordingly, studies of Teilhard easily overlook the individual's body. This work derives a theory of the body and its role in divinization from Teilhard by introducing an anthropological category not present in traditional theological language. Shen, the experiencing body, is the word Xiao uses to describe the Daoist in the process of divinization. Shen challenges conventional notions of body, physicality, and their importance to Christian spiritual life. The experiencing body is a living community of souls in relationship to an essential soul, who receives bonding power from Christ. On their own, humans cannot maintain the relationships within themselves, but must surrender them to perfection in Christ. Biblically, Christian anthropology departed from a monistic to a tripartite view with Paul. In the early Church, Irenaeus and Augustine defended a unity of body and soul against the gnostics heresies. Later, Thomas Aquinas formulated a theory of the body as largely defined by the soul. The bodies did not give positive contributions to people's life in God. Teilhard inherited this view of the human, but was unsatisfied with it. At the same time, he read contemporary French philosophers who provided the spark he needed to develop his ideas on creation and divinization. Early in his writing, he considers the body in light of Christology and biology. He drops the question in favor of strengthening an argument for the divinization of the entire cosmos in the Cosmic Body of Christ. Nonetheless, in the pursuit of this answer, his writings imply the individual body. Human bodies most clearly appear in his mysticism of action, which he explains in The Divine Milieu. Teilhard cannot articulate the individual body because he lacks a cosmology that does not choose between non-subsistent matter and selfsubsistent spirit. Xiao Yingsou's commentary on Daoism's Scripture of Salvation provides such a cosmology. Xiao utilizes both word and image to describe a divinizing cosmic body using three terms: dong, ti, and shen. The individual's body in a process of perfection is shen. This body is not a static collection of interworking parts, but a movement of transformation that generates salvific energy for the entire cosmos. Shen highlights in Teilhard's work a body understood as a community interacting with other beings to perfect relationships in Christ. Therefore, the body is physical, but with Teilhard's expanded notion which exceeds the limitations of time and space. This view yields a body that is not an obstacle to divinization, but absolutely necessary for it.",,,English

Science, it was thought, had to proceed `more geometrico'. I offer a new interpretation of `science emph{more geometrico}' based on an analysis of the explanatory forms used in certain branches of geometry. These branches were optics, astronomy, and mechanics; the so-called subalternate, subordinate, or mixed-mathematical sciences. In Part I, I investigate the nature of the mixed-mathematical sciences according to Aristotle and some `liberal Jesuit' scholastic-Aristotelians. In Part II, the heart of the work, I analyze the metaphysics and physics of Descartes' ""Principles of Philosophy"" (1644, 1647) in light of the findings of Part I and an example from Galileo. I conclude by arguing that we must broaden our understanding of the early modern conception of `science more geometrico' to include concepts taken from the mixed-mathematical sciences. These render the geometrical manner more flexible than previously thought.",,,English

By studying two Jesuit high schools with national reputations for being progressive and inclusive, I looked for ways in which Ignatian educators fulfill this mission. Using a case study model, I examined how these communities have developed, the role of the school's leadership, and the formation experience of the faculty. This study focused on the experience of Black, Latino, and LGBT students in Jesuit high schools. While some Jesuit schools are much further along the journey from tolerance to inclusion, there is still an achievement gap between White students and those who are Black or Latino. Similarly, the LGBT community remains marginalized in many Jesuit high schools. This study recommends adult formation and education for school leaders, faculty, and parents in the areas of diversity and inclusion, and a renewed commitment to educating students justly.",,,English

Le choix de ce thème a été motivé par le fait que pendant ces dernières années la confrontation avec le pluralisme culturel et religieux a conduit la théologie chrétienne à réfléchir de manière nouvelle sur cette question. Elle porte sur le christianisme en tant qu'il a pour spécificité de rendre témoignage à un homme confessé comme le Fils unique de Dieu et le Sauveur de tous les hommes. Dans ce sens, la finalité de notre recherche est de montrer la signification et la portée de l'affirmation de Jésus-Christ comme unique Médiateur de notre salut, et ce dans le cadre de la théologie fondamentale et en particulier de la christologie. Bien que cette doctrine ait été toujours et soit encore une pierre d'achoppement pour ceux qui ne partagent pas notre foi, elle représente pour la tradition chrétienne plus qu'une croyance centrale, elle est vue comme le fondement même de la foi. Pour montrer la pertinence du sujet traité, ainsi que les chemins à suivre afin de proposer de nouvelles perspectives pour la réflexion théologique, notre point de départ est l'analyse du phénomène de la multiplication des modèles interprétatifs concernant le rapport entre le christianisme et les autres religions. Les recherches menées par Peter Schineller, Joseph Gelot, Paul Knitter, Camil Ménard et Jacques Dupuis dans ce domaine, nous ont permis de nous familiariser avec le vocabulaire utilisé dans la discussion (exclusivisme, inclusivisme, pluralisme, etc.) et de percevoir les possibles relations entre les modèles proposés. Du point de vue de notre travail, ces analyses montrent d'une part que la question christologique se trouve au c?ur du débat, et d'autre part que l'enjeu de celui-ci se situe dans la manière dont les théologiens cités comme représentants de chaque modèle, chacun à partir de ses propres présupposés, traitent la question de l'unicité et de l'universalité du Christ. C'est cette double constatation qui nous a amené à choisir d'étudier la pensée de cinq théologiens contemporains: Karl Barth, Hans Urs von Balthasar, Edward Schillebeeckx, Karl Rahner et John Hick. La partie conclusive de la thèse expose les perspectives christologiques qui se dégagent de la recherche. Elle offre une esquisse élaborée avec la conviction que la christologie ne se limite pas à offrir un répertoire d'opinions sur le Christ, mais qu'elle est une réflexion dynamique et attentive aux défis qui lui sont adressés. Notre étude conduit, d'une part, à une prise de distance critique vis-à-vis des modèles ou catégories qui sont proposés aujourd'hui pour expliquer la pluralité d'opinions concernant l'unicité et l'universalité de Jésus-Christ.

Scholars have identified three main types of students who fall under the category of at-risk students: first-generation students, low-income students, and underrepresented students. The reasons for low college-going rates for at-risk students who are traditional in age vary. Some reasons include insufficient college-knowledge within the family or community, low degree aspirations, lack of social support, and insufficient college readiness. Knowledge about a strong college-going culture for at-risk students is limited. There is a gap in research regarding school cultures which promote college attendance for at-risk students. Many studies focus on the barriers and issues that at-risk students face in the college choice process. However, there is a lack of information regarding a school culture designed to prepare at-risk students for attending college. The purpose of this study is to explore a strong college-going culture designed specifically to prepare traditional-age at-risk students for college. The methodology used for the research is a case study. The site selected for the case study is Cristo Rey Jesuit High School Twin Cities.

F., 1904–1984","The contemporary condition of secularity poses a unique environment in which the Church becomes incarnate in the world. The subject of secularity itself has been the focus of serious academic study, and two broad sources of this phenomenon can be drawn from the lifetime work of Charles Taylor: the rise of foundational epistemology and particular changes within the modern social imaginary. These two paradigm shifts have created a latent moral and religious skepticism within contemporary secular society in which it is generally accepted that complex moral and religious issues cannot be arbitrated by reason and must ultimately be decided on the basis of an individual's personal feeling. In this thesis, the author draws on an integration of studies by Charles Taylor and Bernard Lonergan to establish that intellectual, moral, and religious conversion form the basis for the act of knowing and therefore provide an adequate theological response to the problem of skepticism. Furthermore, the author examines the social imaginary particular to contemporary secular society in order to develop a means by which the Church is able draw on sacramentality, communion, catholicity, the liturgy, and cosmology to embody an incarnational spirituality in a secular age.",,,English

Instead of being preoccupied with interpretive questions, I examine the logical rigor and precision of Balthasar's arguments, principally in his Theodramatik, in comparison to that found in Maritain, Ratzinger, Lonergan, and other Thomists. I also evaluate the arguments of some who have already criticized his work from one angle or another. Thorough analysis of Balthasar's fundamental claims yields the conclusion that his theological anthropology, in particular, his understanding of the grace-freedom dynamic, is lacking and detrimentally affects his eschatology. His eschatological position that all men may in fact be saved is a result, primarily, of the simplistic view of grace and freedom that he unwittingly assumes. His theology of the descent, while at points rhetorically excessive, represents a legitimate development and does not necessarily entail universalism. Furthermore, while his trinitarian theory at times borders on the mythological (thanks to Adrienne von Speyr), his understanding of divine suffering may be appropriated in dialogue with Jacques Maritain and Joseph Ratzinger, with whom he is closely allied on many fronts. But in order to reclaim Balthasar's theodramatic approach from its tendency toward universalism (following Karl Barth), attention must be given to the twentieth century developments in the Catholic theology of grace, attention which he did not wish to pay to such purportedly ""neo-scholastic"" debates. The growing consensus that has been emerging, at least among Thomists, concerning the question of the divine permission of moral evil, fills a lacuna in Balthasar's project, derailing it from the path of universalism and setting it on track toward a more robust theological anthropology. A critique of his monumental work along these lines yields a more balanced approach to the task of reconciling God's infinite mercy with the persistent reality of moral evil. The unbounded power of God's grace is not undermined by recognizing the possibility of created freedom to refuse His glory definitively; rather, the natural integrity of human freedom is slighted by an over-emphatic anti-Pelagian view of grace as either inherently irresistible or predetermined to be impotent. The intrinsic efficacy of divine grace and the natural integrity of human freedom together must be affirmed. The eschatological consequence of such a moderate view is precisely a more modest proposal for how in the end God may be ""omnia in omnibus"" (1 Cor 15:28).",,,English

Si le poète est de culture jésuite, le recueil, cependant, atteste en poésie une veine augustinienne en dehors de Port-Royal, liée au milieu spirituel normand de l'époque et à l'influence des oratoriens augustiniens. Brébeuf, réussit une double synthèse. Il parvient à faire coïncider dans la poétique de la méditation une grande partie du protocole et des processus mentaux issus de la spiritualité jésuite avec un fonds augustinien austère et pessimiste, puisé à la fois à la source des Confessions et dans la tradition augustinienne. Brébeuf réussit, par ailleurs, à concilier les principes d'une esthétique mondaine avec la dénonciation des vanités du monde et la volonté de conduire son lecteur, à travers une instance d'énonciation fluctuante et labile, à la pénitence et à la conversion. Les Entretiens solitaires s'affichent comme une vanité littéraire dont les stratégies rhétoriques sont destinées à toucher le lecteur et à faire céder le bastion de son amour-propre pour creuser en lui une capacité susceptible d'être habitée par la grâce de Dieu. Le recueil des Entretiens solitaires, entre baroque et classicisme, aura été l'occasion d'un divertissement pieux qui, en alternant les chants de la Grâce et du Néant, prépare un horizon de conversion, dans un au-delà du texte insaisissable.||Famous in the 1650s, for his gallant and heroic verses, the poet native from Normandy, Georges de Brébeuf, publishes the Solitary Conversations or the Prayers and the meditations in verse French in 1660. Although he belongs to the Jesuit culture, the Solitary Conversations attest in poetry an augustinian vein out of Port-Royal poetry, due to the influence of the Norman spiritual environment and the preponderant part of augustinian oratorians. Brébeuf succeeded in a double synthesis. He made coincide, in the poetics of meditation, a large part of the protocol and the mental processes of Jesuit spirituality with an austere and pessimistic augustinian content, drawn both from the Confessions of Augustine and the augustinian tradition. Moreover, Brébeuf managed to reconcile the principles of worldly aesthetics, with the denunciation of vanities of the world and the will to lead his reader, through a fluctuating and unstable subject of enunciation, to penance and conversion. The Solitary Conversations can really be considered as a literary Vanity which uses some rhetorical strategies to move the reader and to break the bastion of his self-esteem. Once the intimate space became empty of sinner's ""ego"", the divine Grace can fill back this pure capacity. The Solitary Conversations, between baroque and classicism, may have been, for the readers, the occasion of a pious entertainment and, by alternating the songs of the Grace and the Nothingness, may have prepared their conversion, beyond the text. But that rests on a Mystery of God.",2 vols.: Le vol. 1 contient une introduction et le vol. 2 le texte de l'oeuvre.,,French

It is widely observed that believers experience a disconnect between their lives of prayer and worship on the one hand and their workaday lives on the other. Drawing upon the work of philosopher Martin Heidegger, historian Georges Duby, and anthropologist Marcel Mauss, Chauvet constructs a model of Christian existence with sacramentality at its very core---a model which takes full account of the fruitful tension that exists between sacramental worship and daily life. I begin by examining past efforts to grasp the nature of the relationship between sacrament and ethics, including what Vatican Council II brings to the question. Theologians such as Karl Rahner, Edward Schillebeeckx, Bernard Häring, Juan Luis Segundo, Vigen Guroian, Don Saliers, and Virgil Michel all addressed this issue, but like the Council itself, none of these figures examined how sacramental ritual as ritual implicated participants in the living of an ethical life. Subsequent chapters investigate how Chauvet has used post-modern linguistic theory associated with Heidegger and the gift theory associated with Mauss in order to provide a framework for understanding how sacramental ritual inaugurates or re-inaugurates the Christian identity of those who participate in them and also how these rituals of their very nature involve a return-gift to God of loving praxis towards one's neighbors. Aspects of Chauvet's program have been challenged by Henry Mottu, Yves Labbé, Jean-Yves Quellec, Vincent Miller, and Daniel Franklin Pilario. These writers question Chauvet's appropriation of Heidegger and Chauvet's use of anthropological categories. I argue that Chauvet's thought can on the whole be vindicated against these critics. The dissertation concludes by placing Chauvet in dialogue with liberation theologians such as Jon Sobrino and with feminist theologians such as Susan Ross in order to examine how Chauvet's thought can be brought to bear on the concerns such thinkers bring to the table; I also analyze Sunday celebrations in the absence of a priest from the perspective of Chauvet's theology.",,,English

Within Tupi villages, colonial missions and European courts, these ritual vestments played a key role in the creation of a pan-Atlantic colonial interculture. Produced from feathers of the scarlet ibis, these capes played an important role in Tupi corporeality and community. My dissertation attends to the physical qualities of the extant capes and examines the discourses that early modern chroniclers and modern anthropologists constructed around them. Letters by Jesuit missionaries in Brazil surprisingly reveal the continued manufacture and use of Tupi feathered capes within the aldeia (mission) system in both indigenous and Christian rituals. Jesuit missionaries also shipped the capes to Europe, where with other artifacts they extended the conceptual space of colonialism to the Old World. They traveled along social, mercantile and political networks, and entered scholarly and princely collections, where they were studied for their technical mastery and redeployed within court pageantry. ""Brazil"" and the ""Tupinamba"" were concepts mediated by missionaries, merchants, slaves and indigenes in the spatial realms of ports, plantations, missions, marketplaces and courts. The financial incentives of the brazilwood and sugar industries drove European involvement with Brazilian peoples and coastal forests. The Tupi and their plumed artifacts traveled alongside these exported commodities, tangible indices of European economic interests in the New World. By constructing a socio-cultural ""biography"" of the Tupi feathered capes, I trace their changing functions and value as they move from place to place. As ritual vestments, they contributed to the social coding within and among Tupi kinship groups and colonial intermediaries, including early modern merchants, scholars and princes. A reification of the process of social construction, the capes were instrumental in the performance of identity and agency in the colonial nexus. By examining the intersection of these objects with a series of early modern places, people, and institutions I contribute to our knowledge of colonial indigenous traditions within Brazil and of the institutional and economic basis of European engagement with the New World.",,,English

This dissertation proposes a corrective to this conflation: To become the critical component of a public Roman Catholic global just peacebuilding ethic, nonviolence must be understood as distinct from pacifism, as integral to as well as transformative of just-war tradition, and as unifying just war theory and pacifism coherently within Catholic social teaching. The author argues this thesis in four steps. One, Reinhold Niebuhr forged theological ethics' conflation of nonviolence with pacifism through his Christian realist polemics against fellow liberal Protestant Christian pacifists in the 1930s. That conflation migrated into Catholic ethics in the 1950s by way of Protestant ethicist Paul Ramsey and Jesuit John Courtney Murray's shared aim of reclaiming just war theory for the nuclear age. Since 1950, political scientist Gene Sharp's research into nonviolence flatly contradicts Christian ethics' conflation of nonviolence with pacifism. Two, the U.S. Catholic bishops' peace pastoral (1983) and tenth anniversary statement compound the inherited conflation and fail to differentiate nonviolence from pacifism even after witnessing the 1989 nonviolent revolutions. Three, Paul VI and John Paul II's annual World Day of Peace messages (1968–2005) introduce nonviolence into Catholic social teaching but do not conflate nor attempt to integrate nonviolence into just-war tradition. Four, using Sharp's theory of political power to differentiate nonviolence as force from pacifism, the author claims Christian ethics must evaluate strategic nonviolent conflict force with just-war criteria. Then, Christian ethics can begin to craft a coherent global just peacebuilding ethic from within a renewing just-war tradition.--Author's abstract.",,,English

They can be identified in seminal form with specific New Testament passages. The St. Stephen model shows the strength of Christian witness to lead others to Christ, and is based on the martyrdom of St. Stephen (Acts 7:54–-60). The Jerusalem model describes the evangelizing power of the sacred liturgy, and is discerned in the first Christian liturgical celebrations in Jerusalem (Acts 2:42–-47). The Petrine model points to the preaching of the Word, and has its origin in St. Peter's first sermon on the day of Pentecost (Acts 2:14–-41). The Apostolic model highlights the role of the small, fervent community in the propagation of the faith, and is founded on Jesus' selection and commissioning of the Twelve Apostles (Mk 3:13–-19). The Areopagus model involves the inculturation of Christianity in the fabric of society, and looks to St. Paul's address to the Athenians in the Areopagus as its prototype (Acts 17:16–-34). The Loaves and Fishes model calls attention to the evangelizing effects of Christian charity reflected in the corporal and spiritual works of mercy performed by His followers, and is typified in Jesus' healing and feeding the multitudes (Mt 15:29–-38). Each of these models of evangelization is readily observed in every age of Church history. In the American context, the St. Stephen model is illustrated in the courageous Jesuit witness before the native peoples of North America. The Jerusalem model was extensively employed by Junipero Serra and his fellow Franciscans as a primary means of introducing the California Indians to the mystery of Christ. The Petrine model is portrayed in the parish mission crusade that revived the immigrant Church in the nineteenth century. The Apostolic model is represented by the mission of Fr. Hecker and the Paulist Fathers, the first religious order of priests founded in America. The Areopagus model is evident in the life a ...",,,English

Les vastes espaces septentrionaux se consolidèrent alors comme des régions de frontière: les plus lointaines étaient à peine explorées, celles situées plus près des centres de colonisation furent progressivement, mais de manière précaire, intégrées à la monarchie. Au cours du siècle, les missionnaires, notamment franciscains et jésuites, jouèrent un rôle très actif dans le processus d’appropriation de ces marges : en tant qu’explorateurs, évangélisateurs et colonisateurs au service du roi, ils s’insérèrent graduellement dans les espaces du septentrion. Tout d’abord, il fut nécessaire d’imaginer les contrées qui restaient inconnues – la Californie, le Nouveau Mexique : à partir d’une amalgame de mythes et de savoirs à la double origine, européenne et indienne, les religieux dressèrent des cartes et des rapports représentant ces régions convoitées. Avec le passage du temps, la composante américaine desdites représentations s’accentua. Parallèlement, pendant le processus d'incorporation de la Nouvelle-Biscaye, la Compagnie de Jésus y articula un réseau de missions afin de christianiser-« civiliser » les populations et d’occuper les territoires toujours réfractaires à la conquête. Les religieux durent ainsi adapter leurs stratégies d’appropriation aux caractéristiques de l’espace. Enfin, les frontières du Nord génèrent des conditions de vie difficiles pour les missionnaires qui furent parfois découragés de leur travail et conduits vers des comportements peu orthodoxes du point de vue religieux.| |In the XVIIth century, the conquering advance of Spaniards was met by resistance from territories and men in the north of New Spain. The vast septentrional reaches were then consolidated as frontier regions, as the most remote areas were barely explored, while regions located closer to settlement centers were progressively, yet precariously, integrated to monarchy. In the course of the century, missionaries, especially Franciscans and Jesuits, played a very active role in the appropriation process of border regions. As explorers, evangelists and colonizers for the King of Spain, they gradually settled in the septentrional regions. At first, it was necessary to imagine unknown reaches: California, New Mexico. Picking from a set of myths and knowledge with a dual – European and Native American – origin, the priests drew up maps and reports of the coveted areas. As time passed, representations showed increased American influence. In parallel, as integration of New Biscay progressed, the Company of Jesus articulated a network of missions with the objective to christianize – “civilize” – populations and occupy the territories that resisted conquest. The missionaries had to adapt their appropriation strategies to land characteristics. Finally, missionaries had to face difficult life conditions at the northern frontiers, and were at times disheartened in their work and lapsed into rather unorthodox behaviors from a religious point of view.",,,French

Using what we call direct comparative method among the principles which make up the arts of words in this case the religious lecturing and the theatrical representation we came to the writings of the Spiritual Exercising from Inácio de Loyola, which establish in its proposals the resources used as tools in the development of the Jesuitical lecturing art. With the support of Mario Iannaccones thesis, we came to the outstanding excerpt from the filmmaker Sergei Einsenstein General Theory of the Montage, which helped us understand how such principles of Spiritual Exercising from Inácio de Loyola are also present in the art of the 20th century Russian playwright. Recognizing the importance of word elaboration in such arts lecturing and theatric performance and realizing that such a word aims, in both cases, at a psychological transformation of its hearer, respectively the conversion through the sermons and the catharsis in the theatre, we checked how such word is supposed to be elaborated from the principles proposed by these two authors. To do so, we studied in Marina Massimi the conceptions of the psychiatric dynamisms which serve as a basis for the Jesuit authors in their proposals of word construction in their lectures. Inspired in Margarida Vieira Mendes, who is an expert in Antonio Vieira, some items were transcript to indicate as belonging to the Sermon of the Sixtieth and a brief script to help understand in a direct way the similarities to be investigated regarding the lecturing arts of the 16th and 17th century preachers and the theatre in Constantin Stanislavski.

Unlike most prior research, this study distinguishes between students attending Jesuit institutions and students attending other Roman Catholic institutions when examining the relationship between institutional religious affiliation and deep learning and student engagement. The study develops composite measures for Jesuit values using available items from the NSSE. Results suggest that even after controlling for student and institutional characteristics, students attending Jesuit, other Roman Catholic, and other faith-based institutions achieve higher average scores than students at nonsectarian institutions on measures of Jesuit values, deep learning, and student engagement. Findings also suggest that college students who se",,,English

In the Pampas, the Spaniards did not encounter large, farming Indian populations like those of central Mexico or the Andean highlands, but mobile hunter-gatherers whom they were unable to conquer and subdue. Using an ethnohistorical approach, this dissertation shows that although Indians remained independent, they thoroughly reinvented their societies under the multidimensional impact of the Spanish arrival, which included ecological changes, epidemics, slaving raids, and intercultural commerce. Most dramatically, the Pampa Indians became superb horse-riders, deft hunters of (feral) cattle, avid consumers of Spanish manufactures, and an integral part of long-distance exchange networks that extended west across the Andes and reached into southern Chile. On the basis of this ethnohistorical understanding of the Pampas, this dissertation offers an ambitious reconsideration of Buenos Aires' early colonial period. The intersection of Andean and Atlantic trade circuits in Buenos Aires during the seventeenth century provided the stimuli for the development of cattle ranching as a main local economic activity. Spanish settlers adapted Iberian cattle-ranching practices to the challenges and opportunities of the Pampas by developing a hunting industry to exploit the proliferating herds of feral livestock that roamed the plains. Such hunting industry put the Spaniards in direct contact, and competition, with the Indians who inhabited the Pampas and with the Indians who arrived seasonally from the Andean zone to hunt and trade. The dissertation examines the complex intercultural and intertribal relations that ensued, which included Indian raids, military expeditions, diplomatic negotiations and treaties, and short-lived Jesuit missions. By the 1750s, these relations had resulted in the emergence of a militarized frontier line lying barely a hundred miles southwest of Buenos Aires. This frontier line defined intercultural relations in the Pampas for the next hundred years, and became a fundamental element in the narrative of Argentina's emergence as a modern nation in the early twentieth century.",,,English

During these years the colony served as a haven for hundreds of thousands who were fleeing Japanese expansion. A central aspect of Macau's war experience was the internal life of the colony. However, little or no published or archival material is available on this subject. Accordingly, the only feasible way to study this aspect of the territory's history is to draw on the testimony of those who in fact did experience wartime conditions in Macau. For the interview process, subjects were selected who belong to a distinct ethno-cultural group that has emerged from Macau's Portuguese and Chinese heritages - the Macanese. Besides the Macanese community resident in Macau, there are also several diasporic communities around the world. Many members of these communities spent the duration of the war in Macau as refugees, and the interview process clearly showed that members of the diasporic and resident Macanese communities had qualitatively different memories of the Second World War. Furthermore, the recollections of the Portuguese Jesuit priest Father Manuel Teixeira have played a prominent if idiosyncratic role in perceptions of Macau's Second World War experience, and so his testimony is discussed in relation to that of the Macanese. The way in which those interviewed expressed their perceptions of the past seemed to be rooted in and shaped by their experiences both before and since the war. Memory is, in other words, a construct. By analysing these narrated memories in terms of the existing theoretical literature on oral history and collective memory, this thesis strives to shed light on the connections between experience, memory, and the construction of the Second World War in the resident and diasporic Macanese communities.",,,English

Looking through the indices of Archivum Historicum Societatis Iesu, the journal of the Jesuits’ Historical Institute in Rome, I came upon an article contained in a bound volume of journals entitled “Musical Activity in the Church of the Gesu in Rome during the Early Baroque” by Graham Dixon. While reading the article, I quickly found a reference in one of the footnotes that piqued my interest. This reference began with a four-letter prefix that I did not know. It read “ARSI Chiesa del Gesu, libro 2007, Or dine et Osservationi della nostra Chiesa per tutto L’Anno.” Though I immediately recognized the reference to the Church of the Gesu, the four upper-case|letters confused me.

I wondered how many details it might provide to answer the question of the Jesuits’ early use of liturgical music. During the remainder of the week I searched further, looking through seemingly endless boxes of original musical manuscripts from the seventeenth century, interesting potentials for other projects in the future. Particularly in light of the belief of some that the Jesuits were anti-musical and that Ignatius had turned his back on music, I began by looking for a primary source book or original project that was connected to music and the Jesuits. Through all the searching I found myself repeatedly coming back to CDG2007, a reference book of ceremonial instructions on the liturgical rituals performed at the Gesu.

Most scholars have considered sign-language, pantomime, and other nonverbal means of communication (visual, sonorous, tactile, etc.), as temporary, imperfect, and insignificant solutions to the lack of mutual linguistic understanding during early colonial encounters. It is also often assumed that these means of communication, combined with seemingly insurmountable cultural differences, inevitably promoted misunderstandings, incomprehension, and violent conflicts between early colonists and native populations. Seeking to challenge these assumptions, this work closely analyzes the nature, origins, change over time, and cultural implications of nonverbal and paralinguistic forms of communication, which I argue importantly contributed to the accommodation process and the emergence of cultural hybridity in the early French-Indian Atlantic. This dissertation offers to expand and refine our understanding of cross-cultural communication and miscommunication in various colonial settings. To do so, it brings in a comparative perspective the experiences of a wide range of French explorers, missionaries, colonial officials, mariners, soldiers, and settlers with a variety of native peoples, cultures, and societies in Brazil, Florida, the Caribbean, Canada, and the Upper Mississippi Valley, from 1500 to the conclusion of the Great Peace of Montreal in 1701. Research for this project was conducted in both published and archival sources, using the original French language versions of the sources, for which I provide new or first translations. The comparative scope of this work brings into question the predominant Canadian-centered chronology that has lead past studies of French America, and seeks to put grater emphasis on the influence that local indigenous cultures and contexts had on colonial developments and in shaping the alliance. Through five thematic/chronological chapters, my work traces the emergence of a culturally-syncretic repertoire for communication in the early French Atlantic, in which non-linguistic elements were at least as important as spoken words to mediate relations between individuals and groups. Starting with the emergence of shared nonverbal codes during first contacts, the project then explores the process of acculturation as a sensory journey through otherness, then demonstrates the permanence of nonverbal means of communication during and after the mutual acquisition of language by French and Indians. It provides an in-depth look at the role of nonverbal performances in ceremonial oratory in seventeenth-century New France with particular attention to the contest between Jesuit and Indian orators. The dissertation ends with a comparison of nonverbal dimensions of diplomacy in New France and the Caribbean, until the eve of the eighteenth century.",,,English

Sie möchte untersuchen, wie Karl Rahner (1904–1984), einer der einflussreichsten katholischen Theologen des 20. Jahrhunderts und ein Mann der offenen Augen, dieses Problem in seinen Schriften behandelt.|Das Theodizee-Thema entzieht sich bei Rahner in den meisten Fällen und wurde deshalb in der Sekundärliteratur bislang allenfalls am Rande gestreift, jedoch nicht ausführlich – mit Bezug auf einschlägige Textstellen – behandelt. Auch nach den Gründen, warum Rahner sich kaum dazu geäußert hat, wurde noch nicht eingehender gefragt. Diese Lücke möchte die Arbeit schließen.|Um einen Zugang zu Rahners Werk zu finden, wurde eine Stichwortsuche durchgeführt und die gefundenen Textstellen auf ihre Relevanz hin analysiert. Zunächst wurde dabei in allgemeiner Form nach der Theodizee-Thematik gefragt. Im zweiten Schritt wurde der Tatsache Rechnung getragen, dass Rahner seine Schriften zum großen Teil „nach Auschwitz“ verfasst hat, als sich die Theodizeefrage in verschärfter Form neu stellte. In besonderer Weise wurde Rahners Aufsatz „Warum läßt uns Gott leiden?“ berücksichtigt.|Es fällt auf, dass Rahner insbesondere das Problem des Bösen beschäftigt. Wenn er auch die Rückfrage an Gott offenhält, wehrt er sich doch im Sinne Augustins und in Frontstellung gegenüber Tendenzen seiner Zeit, das Phänomen der Schuld zu unterschlagen, dagegen, den Menschen aus der Verantwortung zu entlassen. Tendenziell ist eine Reduktion der Frage auf eine Theodizee des je eigenen Todes zu beobachten, was Rahners transzendentaltheologischem Ansatz geschuldet sein dürfte. Danach ist der Mensch grundsätzlich dazu aufgefordert, sich dem unbegreiflichen Geheimnis seines Daseins anzuvertrauen. Insofern hat Theodizee nichtbegreifend, in Glaube, Hoffnung und Liebe zu geschehen. Auschwitz bedeutet nach Rahner eine fundamentale Erschütterung des Gottesglaubens, der aber – gerade im Blick auf die Opfer der Geschichte – ein Gebot der Nächstenliebe bleibt, bietet er doch eine Perspektive der Hoffnung.||This thesis deals with the question of God that is central to theology, more particularly with the vital question of God and human suffering. Its purpose is to analyze the way in which Karl Rahner (1904–1984), one of the most influential theologians of the 20th century and a man with eyes wide open on things, treats this problem in his writing.|In Rahner the topic of theodicy is difficult to grasp in most cases and has therefore been dealt with – if at all – in a marginal way in secondary literature; but it has never been treated in any depth and with direct reference to pertinent text passages. Furthermore, the reasons why Rahner hardly ever dealt with the subject explicitly have not yet been focused on. This thesis means to close this gap.|In order to approach Rahner’s work a keyword search has been made and the references found have been analyzed with regard to their relevance. During a first approach the question of the theodicy topic was asked more generally. In a second step it was taken into account that Rahner wrote most of his works “after Auschwitz” when the question of theodicy was put anew and more poignantly. Particular consideration was given to Rahner’s essay “Why does God allow us to suffer?”.|Obviously the problem of evil is his main concern. Even though he admits the reproachful question to God, he follows Augustine and is in opposition to tendencies of his time that reject the phenomenon of guilt, when he refuses to relieve man from personal responsibility. There seems to be a tendency to reduce the question to a theodicy of individual death; this may be due to Rahner’s transcendental-theological approach. According to this approach man is principally asked to have confidence in the incomprehensible mystery of his existence. Insofar theodicy has to come about – non-comprehendingly – in faith, hope and love.|As to Rahner, Auschwitz marks a fundamental challenge to the belief in God, which remains however – especially with regard to the victims of history – a commandment of brotherly love, offering a perspective of hope.",Institut für Systematische Theologie,,German

Revising existing interpretations, it argues that both clerical and lay Catholics, chief among them the printer Mathew Carey, carefully negotiated the first Catholic presence in the public sphere through the medium of print. This early Catholic culture appropriated ""enlightened"" rhetoric and modes of expression in order to critique the anti-Catholic legacy of the Colonial period that viewed Catholicism as a remnant of the ""Dark Ages"" and incompatible with republicanism. I argue that this pervasive historical view of Catholicism as anti-progressive is key to understanding the persistence of anti-Catholicism in the history-conscious early republic. Catholics of this era strove to define the public face of the Church in America as sympathetic to the dominant values of the founding generation, and to dispute Whig historical views of Catholicism's role in history, especially the history of England and then Britain. In this era, I argue, anti-Catholicism can be viewed as primarily ideological in nature.; Mathew Carey's brand of republican Catholicism brought from Ireland in the 1780s provided an existing model for this experiment, and like-minded American-born Catholics such as first bishop John Carroll also attempted to carefully control perceptions of the new church as ""foreign."" This was achieved through printed statements addressed to American Catholics, to President Washington, in responses to renegade or outspoken Catholic clergy, through Catholic devotional and instructional publications, the printing and marketing of the first Douai Bible in America, critiques of Whig history, and in Carey's participation in an extended newspaper controversy sparked by a derogatory reference to Catholic doctrine made by a politician.; By the time of Carey's death in 1839, this experiment in enlightened, republican Catholicism ended, as the Church, facing renewed anti-Catholicism that arose in reaction to massive ethnic Catholic immigration, ghettoized itself into an enclosed sub-culture increasingly viewed as dominated by ""foreign"" clerical leadership.",,,English

F., 1904–1984","This dissertation is a comparative study of spiritual cultivation in Early Daoism and the spiritual teaching of Augustine's Christianity. My goal is to examine how early Daoism's founder, Laozi, and the Christian bishop, Augustine of Hippo, characterize the fulfillment of humanity through religious transformation. My argument is that the metaphysical speculations that figure in their works---and which scholarly readers often emphasize---are offshoots of profound practical, soteriological concerns. These soteriological concerns reveal that the primary interest for both writers was to discover those spiritual and intellectual practices that could most effectively mediate between human experience and the manifestation of transcendent order. This study takes its inspiration from pioneering instances of comparative theology (particularly works by Francis Clooney S.J. and Lee Yearly), and focuses on the cross-reading of texts. For Laozi, the basic text used in this study is. For Augustine, the primary text is de Trinitate, with some Daode Jing closely related writings. Both texts play similar formative roles in their respective religious traditions. My methodology also makes heuristic use of Bernard Lonergan's study of the fourfold operation of human consciousness as experience, understanding, judgment and decision. This general description of human consciousness is a useful framework to draw out similarities and differences in these texts. The primary thematic interest of the thesis is ethical. I explore how early Daoism and Augustine's Christianity were both animated by the concern to confront human violence through spiritual exercises and the renewal of authentic humanity. In comparing Daode Jing and de Triniate, I consider the ways that each author's encounter with social violence shaped their intellectual projects. Laozi and Augustine's search for transcendent order was motivated by the hope of overcoming disordered human desires. This task required an understanding of human participation in transcendent order which could be realized in direct realms of experience, through knowledge of the operations of interior consciousness and the practice of daily spiritual exercises. Though both thinkers are often treated in dogmatic or philosophical terms, their primary interest was in practical spirituality, a way of living. Both Laozi and Augustine searched for `the Way"" for disciples of their respective traditions to nurture personal life and to maintain hope as a religious community in a turbulent world. These issues are dealt with in four chapters. In Chapter One I develop my theoretical framework and the categories of the hermeneutics of consciousness. In Chapter Two I reconstruct the political-religious context of Chinese culture that the author of Daode Jing criticized . Against this context, I then explain in Chapter Three Laozi's major insights into the nature of transcendent order, particularly his understanding of its character as Three in One (Self-so, Nothing and Something), specified in Daode Jing. In Chapter Four I expound Augustine's development of the doctrine of the Trinity as the fundamental signature of divine reality, which is also reflected in the structure of human subjectivity. This leads to Chapter Five where I consider these two views as dialogical partners and advance the view that a juxtapositional reading of these two texts leads to new insights through the way that each can be said to develop a distinctive interpretation of the concept ""effortless action.""",,,English

Thinking highly of knowledge is also the important cultural aspect of the western civilization. Not only the Macartney embassy in 1793 is a good case for researching this kind of phenomenon, but also an alternative new perspective to reconsider the Chinese modern history. Compared with the western embassy before, the Macartney embassy possessed the character of scientific investigation team and the specific characteristic of intentionally showing the English civilization (technology and industry) in the character of present as well. The embassy purposely brought quite a few advanced instruments and weapons as presents, including the newest industrial manufactures, mechanical models and scientific instruments and so on (the total sum is 29). There are even novel technological devices, such as hot balloon and diving bell, in order to manifest the priority of its material civilization. However, the main purpose of displaying presents is not for transmitting scientific gospel, so blaming the emperor Qiang-long for not grasping the opportunity of modernization, so called modernization discourse, is not reasonable. Collecting all kinds of Chinese technical information, such as paktong, nankeen, and tea-producing, by means of scientific investigation, the embassy had certain impacted on the lost of the world market advantage of the Chinese manufactures afterwards. Besides the embassys observation on every aspects of the Chinese society is apparently different from the Chinese image provided by the Jesuits, so it recast and rewrote the good impressions and fancies of western society on Chinese and ended the chinoiserie of the west at last.

It does refer to an inner change of heart (affective conversion), a change of viewpoint (intellectual conversion), actions enacted out of a choice of values over satisfaction (moral conversion), and ultimately the inner shift that occurs when grasped by God and moved in love (religious conversion). These questions will be explored through psychological considerations, understandings of spiritual development, theological reflection, and the call beyond to authentic self-transcending intentional loving",,,English

Eliot,"Wellington, New Zealand",Victoria University of Wellington,,MA thesis,,,http://hdl.handle.net/10063/3571,,,Culture -- Theory|Literature -- Poetry -- Criticism,,"de Certeau, Michel, 1925–1986","T. S. Eliot remains a literary giant close to fifty years after his death while David Jones, in contrast, is undeniably a marginal figure in the world of poetry but one who is slowly gaining a larger profile. Jones has from the very beginning been aligned with Eliot by virtue of Eliot's own comments and by a succession of critics who cast him as Eliot's disciple. The time has come, however, for the side notes to Eliot, which have become almost a convention of Jonesian criticism, to be expanded into a detailed comparative study between his and Eliot's work. Eliot scholars appear to show no interest in pursuing comparisons to Jones, as he is hardly mentioned, even in passing, in discussions of Eliot's work. This too, is something that deserves to be reassessed. Undertaking a new approach to Jones-Eliot comparisons develops Jones criticism and opens up a new branch of Eliot studies. This thesis repositions Jones and Eliot from the way they have, thus far, been critically related to one another by focusing on liminal space in both poets major texts: The Anathemata, In Parenthesis, The Waste Land, and Four Quartets. This threshold space can be found in their landscapes and in the way they adapt poetic techniques, such as imagery and juxtapositions of irreconcilable opposites. The between-space of transition manifested in their texts reflects the wider environment of flux and transition Jones and Eliot experienced in the first half of the twentieth century. Using the work of a range of literary critics, historians, philosophers, and geographers, including Arnold van Gennep, Victor Turner, Michel Foucault, Edward W. Soja, Michel de Certeau, Andrew Thacker, Thomas Dilworth, David Harvey, and Stephen Kern, establishes a spatially focused model of liminality which facilitates a close reading of these spaces in Jones's and Eliot's work.",,,English

At the heart of this preoccupation lie Balthasar's reflections on what Martin Heidegger referred to as the existential fact of man's openness to Being. For Balthasar, this Heideggerian insight is to be understood in terms of an encounter between finite human freedom and infinite divine freedom. One can argue that Balthasar's focus on ""the encounter"" is the internal logic guiding his literary output prior to the writing of his famous trilogy and that this internal logic determines Balthasar's understanding of the relationship between form (Gestalt ) and freedom (Freiheit )---arguably the two central themes of his mature thought. This dissertation examines Balthasar's understanding of the encounter, while attempting to document how the encounter is the interpretive key to his entire literary oeuvre. Such an examination will not only make possible a coherent reading of his overall thought but also present that thought in terms of a singular and ubiquitous theme. The first part of the dissertation will address the emergence of the encounter as the central preoccupation of Balthasar's thought. First, an analysis will be given of his engagement with modern German thinkers in his early work Apokalypse tier deutschen Seele, in which he identifies the turn to the subject of modern German thought as a tragic misreading of the encounter with the infinite. Second, an examination of Balthasar's subsequent theological response to the phenomenon of a dominant subjectivity will be considered in light of Balthasar's retrieval of patristic anthropology and Christology. The major patristic figures to be assayed will be Origen, Gregory of Nyssa, and Maximus the Confessor. The second part will document the development of a synthesis in Balthasar's early theological insights on the encounter by presenting the philosophical and psychological dimensions of the encounter that he provides in his Wahrheit der Welt and Die Christ und die Angst. The third part will explore the relationship between the two central themes of Balthasar's trilogy---Gestalt and freedom---and demonstrate how Balthasar's earlier work on the encounter is the key to understanding this relationship as it is worked out in Herrlichkeit and Theodramatik. Final remarks will address recent criticisms of Balthasar's thought, a proposal of the originality of Balthasar's reading of the encounter, and a critique of the only other reading available in English of the logic of Balthasar's thought.",,,English

I investigate the various ways in which worship within the Gesù employed sense perception as a method of facilitating devotion. In this vein, the use of preaching, visual arts, architecture, and music individually and collectively demonstrate that Jesuits were keenly aware that stimulating the senses would result in a more emotional and mystical form of devotion. For this investigation, the original sacristy manual of the Gesù is employed to reconstruct the liturgy. Linking this to sense perception, the long-standing tradition of the application of the senses within the Society of Jesus is explored. Also, this thesis analyzes how this tradition created a uniquely Ignatian liturgy in the Gesù that, while conforming with the Tridentine Church, was grounded in Ignatius’ beliefs that one could come closer to the divine through the senses.",,,English

In each instance, the Jesuits faced obstacles to their efforts to Catholicize the Christian Orient. Through an examination of the Jesuit experience in the early modern Ottoman Empire, I argue that particular historiographical trends concerning confession-building, early modern empire-building, and globalization need to be revised. First, rather than seeing the consolidation and alliance of religious practice and political allegiance as institutionally forced through negotiation and resistance, I argue that the unique experiences of individuals demonstrate how confessionalization was not just a question of institutional control or communal solidarity, but was driven by individual desires to conform to a confessional identity, a process I call self-confessionalization. Second, this project revises the historiographical notion of the Jesuits as participants in European imperialism. I argue against the notion that the Jesuits were willful agents of European monarchs and the papacy, but rather that the Jesuits were forced to negotiate their place between Rome and the Ottoman world. They had to amend their missionary efforts based on the circumstances in which they found themselves, and this often ran contrary to the wishes of their patrons. Finally, I argue that the Jesuits in the early modern Ottoman Empire were equal participants in a global process of group identity formation that centered on the development and maintenance of borders along the lines of religious confession and larger cultural identities. They participated in this global exchange on both individual and collective levels, demonstrating that the early stages of globalization depended upon cooperation between the major powers of the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. In sum, the Jesuit missions to the Ottoman world lay bare the existence of intersecting processes",,,English

O caminho era uma trilha indígena da época pré-colombiana que atravessava a América do Sul, do oceano Atlântico ao Pacífico, passando por Paraná, Santa Catarina, São Paulo, Mato Grosso, Paraguai e Bolívia. Exerceu importante papel na formação do atual território paranaense, pois foi utilizado por aventureiros, jesuítas, exploradores e colonizadores europeus. Atualmente são raros os vestígios encontrados, porém existem documentos cartográficos e bibliográficos que descrevem sua localização, e, com base nestes traçou-se o roteiro do caminho sobre o atual território paranaense. A partir desta espacialização do caminho de Peabiru, foram realizadas pesquisas a campo, em nível regional, no norte da COMCAM, buscando levantar aspectos históricos e culturais da região, para formação de um banco de dados georreferenciados e criação do SIG-CAMINHO DE PEABIRU NA COMCAM. O banco de dados é a base para a delimitação de roteiros de peregrinação, que incentivam o desenvolvimento do turismo rural, e outras atividades relacionadas. Subsidia, também, a tomada de decisões por parte do poder público quanto ao investimento de capital, nesta área, e a confecção de mapas que auxiliam a análise espacial dos dados e a divulgação do turismo, em meio analógico e digital (Internet).||This paper discusses the application of geoprocessing in the creation of a data base and tourist routes, having as its central theme the Peabiru Trail, in COMCAM. At the Pre-Colombian time, the Peabiru Trail used to be a native trail that passed through the South America, from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean, going through Paraná, Santa Catarina, São Paulo, Mato Grosso, Paraguay and Bolivia. It had an important role in the formation of the current Paraná territory, because it was used by adventurers, Jesuits, explorers and European settlers. Nowadays, it is rare to find vestiges, however there are cartographic and bibliographic documents that describe its localization and, based on them, the route of the trail was traced on the current Paraná territory. From that spatial localization of the Peabiru Trail, field researches have been carried out in regional level, in the North of COMCAM, to try to gather historic and cultural aspects of the region in order to create a georeferenced data base and SIG-PEABIRU TRAIL IN COMCAM as well. The data base is the basis for the delimitation of peregrination routes, which is an incentive for the development of rural tourism and other related activities. Furthermore, it also subsidizes the decision making of the public power concerning capital investment in this area and the making of maps that help the data spatial analysis and making tourism known in analogical and digital (Internet) ways.",,,Portuguese

The technology of recording moving images on magnetic tape, previously of use only to broadcasters, became a tool for artistic expression, psychological experimentation, and political revolution. Video became portable not only materially but also culturally; it could be carried by an individual, but it could also be carried into institutions from the RAND Corporation to the Black Panther Party, from psychiatrists' offices to art galleries, and from prisons to state-funded media access centers. Between 1967 and 1973, American videographers across many of these institutional contexts participated in a common discourse, sharing not only practical knowledge about the uses and maintenance of video equipment, but visions of its social significance, psychological effects, and utopian future. For many, video was a technology which would bring about a new kind of awareness, the communal consiousness that—influenced by the evolutionary philosophy of Henri Bergson—Pierre Teilhard de Chardin referred to as the noosphere and Marshall McLuhan as the global village. Experimental videographers across several fields were also influenced by the psychedelic research of the 1950s and early 1960s, by the development of cybernetics as a science of both social systems and interactions between humans and machines, by anthropology and humanistic psychology, and by revolutionary political movements in the United States and around the world.",,,English

Through a complex interaction of different imaginative functions, Loyola's text is able to superpose a variety of simultaneous narrative levels. In order to reformulate the ""greater narrative"" (the Magisterium) of the Roman faith beyond what is revealed in Scripture, the Spiritual Exercises require their exercitant to become an active participant in this narrative through constant visual contact with ""orders of corruption,"" that is, spaces in which virtue can be confronted with physical decay and sin. It is through these spaces that Counter-Reformation Rome (La Roma Ignaziana) will redefine the economy of salvation and diffuse the visual dynamics of the Spiritual Exercises throughout the Catholic world. Spanish Golden Age authors Miguel de Cervantes and Baltasar Gracian are well aware of this diffusion and use the rising Modernity of the novel to transform Loyola's notion of ""orders of corruption''; they adapt it to secular reality in their writings. Their encoded criticism of Loyolan imagination contributes to the epistemological crisis that marks the Baroque age, but also prepares the way for the crucial debates that will take place during the Enlightenment (such as the deconstruction of the Catholic ""greater narrative"" reflected in Loyola). This dissertation therefore concludes with a discussion of the eventual negation of Loyolan imagination in the novels of the marquis de Sade. As an ex-student of the Jesuits, Sade undermines the Roman faith by parodying the Baroque forms of spiritual visual experience and negates the Loyolan projection into ""orders of corruption.""",,,English

Through an examination of the first documented musical contact between the Iroquois and the Jesuits in the 17th century, Chapter 2 addresses the question of when, under what conditions and for what reasons the Iroquois adopted European religious musical practices. Through the musical experiences as documented in the official reports of a residential school, Chapter 3 discusses the changing attitude of Canadian officialdom towards Native people and the impact these changing attitudes may have had on the acquisition of hymns by Six Nations. It examines the way that Native people were perceived as indicative of the ""Indian problem,"" why government and residential school officials chose the policy of assimilation, how music was implicit in the assimilation policy, what effects this policy had on the way in which Native people were exposed to Western music, and whether these effects were lasting and total. By looking more specifically at one hymn, ""The Lord's My Shepherd"" and how its story reveals both its history and the processes of adaptation, Chapter 4 presents the history, performance aesthetics, performance practices and social meanings in a contemporary performance of this hymn. Embedded in its musical fabric are a number of genealogical threads: Scottish words sung to an English melody, acquired by the Iroquois, translated into Mohawk and using a performance style bearing a non-Western aesthetic. This thesis is illustrative of how one comes to appreciate the music of other cultures, and what responsibility a listener has towards coming to an informed understanding of another culture's music: through becoming aware of its values, history and social practices.",,,English

Through close readings, the dissertation draws attention to how Spanish cultural texts ranging from the 19th to the 21st century foreground that realist fiction's capacity to redeem and preserve certain events that have been left out of contemporary Spanish public discourse. The introduction presents a discussion of the views on history of Walter Benjamin, Hayden White, and Michel De Certeau, as well as a study of the conceptualizations of literary realism by Georg Lukács and Bertolt Brecht, and filmic realism by Andre Bazin, Siegfried Kracauer, and Gilles Deleuze. The first chapter analyzes three novels, Benito Pérez Galdós's La Primera República, César M. Arconada's Reparto de Tierras, and Ramón J. Sender's Mr. Witt en el Cantón, and Luis Buñuel's film Las Hurdes; Tierra sin Pan. These four works focus on the two periods of republican governance in Spain: 1873–74, and 1936–39. The second chapter examines Carlos Saura's film La Caza and Luis Martín-Santos's novel Tiempo de Silencio. My analysis shows how both works highlight the failure of Francoism through the representation of individuals who had not been assimilated by the pervasive narrative of the regime. The third chapter questions the unresolved problems generated throughout the Civil War and Francoism. By focusing on repressed memories as represented in Suso de Toro's novel Non Volvas, and the social exclusion generated throughout the post-Franco years in Alejandro González Iñárritu's film Biutiful, my analysis engages with the unsettled past, upon which a shaky present has been built. The dissertation further examines how conceptualizations of literary and filmic realism have changed over time, responding to transformations in Spanish society by adhering to a commitment to exposing the sufferings and contradictions inherent in society, and a strong interest in the everyday life of the middle and lower classes, challenging conceptualizations of history and time in Spain’s development as a nation.",,,English

A close reading and analysis of West African short fiction will allow us to examine how through everyday creative practices and within their own private spheres the represented individuals reestablish a space of agency previously denied to them. The first part of our study will consist in presenting the various conditions of emergence of African short fiction. We will look at the socio–political context and at the role of the short story writer, the publishing industry as well as the reception of African short fiction in Africa and abroad, which will allow us to emphasize the intrinsic link between dignity, agency and development. Secondly, we will focus on the writing of the collective memory of war, trauma and violence and on the numerous creative strategies used by the characters to reaffirm their existence, to fight against violence and to heal from trauma. The final part of this study will examine the stylistic and linguistic strategies used by West African short fiction writers to create a rupture with the colonial literary tradition and to reinvent a new short story genre.",,,French

The marginalization of affectivity impoverishes moral theory and the moral life. Therefore, affectivity needs to be positively incorporated into theories of normativity and moral action. Karl Rahner's retrieval of concupiscentia lays the groundwork to reintegrate affectivity with the capacities of reason in order to utilize both as sources of moral knowledge. He asserts that theological concupiscence describes the existential relationship between nature (finitude) and person (freedom).|Rahner's perspective on theological concupiscence incorporated into moral theology with the fundamental option theory---which places human action in the context of grace---recast the manner in which moral theologians define and comprehend moral acts. Right action could no longer simply be read from nature, nor was right moral action achieved by simply following the faith community's norms and avoiding proscribed behaviors. Klaus Demmer connects the fundamental option to vocational decisions providing a framework for a transcendental analysis of moral action. In this context, the dialectical relationship between experience and insight comes to the fore. Insights set the stage for new experiences of grace, which in turn lead to nuanced or new insights. The nuanced or new insights should lead to new forms of action in the world.|Sidney Callahan, Beverly Harrison, and Margaret Farley deliberately integrate affectivity into their psychological or moral theory, offsetting the split between affectivity and reason. In doing so, they affirm the reality that as humans we are affective-reasoning beings. In addition, Farley uses ""embodied spirits"" or ""inspirited bodies"" to discuss human freedom and finitude drawing attention to our embodiment as an aspect of theological concupiscence. Together, they help recast the person-nature relationship (theological concupiscence) in a broader moral theological context allowing for a positive role for affectivity in normative and moral action theories. This re-configured matrix permits a more harmonious and reciprocal relationship between affectivity and reason where both can be utilized as resources for normative and moral action theories, enriching moral theory, our moral reasoning, and our view of the moral life.",,,English
Dissertation,"Craft, Peter C.",2010,"Warfare, Trade, and 'Indians' in British Literature, 1652–1711",Urbana,University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,"vi, 239",PhD diss.,,,http://hdl.handle.net/2142/15506,,17th century|18th century,Foreign Missions -- Native Americans|Foreign Missions -- History -- Regional,Europe -- UK -- England|Asia -- India,,"My dissertation builds upon and challenges postcolonial interpretations of British perceptions of East and West “Indians” in the long eighteenth century. I argue that extremely popular voyage narratives during this period reflected and shaped British people’s tendency to view Mughal Indians as similar and in some ways even superior to Europeans. This special status, which was also accorded to the Chinese, did not extend to American “Indians.” I begin my study with the origins of the mistaken term “Indian” as applied to American Indians by European “discoverers” in the late fifteenth century. Although the indigenous peoples of the Americas continued to be called “Indians” by Europeans for centuries after Amerigo Vespucci realized Columbus had “found” a separate continent rather than a new route to India, I argue that British writers were keenly aware of the difference between “Indians” in the Eastern and Western hemispheres by the mid-seventeenth century. In fact, before the death of the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb in 1707, British men and women greatly admired a country that was far more wealthy, spacious, and militarily powerful than their own. The inhabitants of the Americas, however, were decimated by the European transmission of smallpox and lacked the military technology of India and Europe. Consequently, the European colonization of the Americas, and its accompanying devaluation of the native peoples, began much earlier and lasted much longer there than in India (where the British presence did not become significant until Robert Clive’s victory at the Battle of Plassey in 1757). Peter Heylyn’s critically neglected 1652 Cosmographie (eight editions before 1700), a collection of voyage narratives from sailors, merchants, and Jesuits that represented at least a century of European perceptions of the rest of the world, shows that a sharp distinction was made between, on the one hand, the “Indians” in the Americas and, on the other hand, the inhabitants of the Mughal Empire in India proper. Drawing also on representations of “Indians” in the works of canonical literary authors in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries such as John Dryden, Richard Steele, and Henry Mackenzie, my dissertation provides a more nuanced account of the origins and (d)evolution of “Indian” stereotypes than scholars have to date.",,,English

Specifically, the project interrogates the Franciscan propagation of miracle-working objects--from the championing of popular Marian images in the seventeenth century to the crafting of potent sculptures and their dissemination in the eighteenth--and attempts to relate these activities to the socio-political and religious landscape of late colonial New Spain. Thus, the Franciscan advancement of numinous objects, seldom the focus of concentrated study, is here minutely examined and historically contextualized.|The Order's early investment in images--namely, the didactic image--was central to the sixteenth-century Franciscan missionary project. Yet while this period is traditionally seen as one in which the mendicant order rejected the concept of thaumaturgic objects--reticence towards the Virgin of Guadalupe is traditionally emphasized--the study argues for a more nuanced reading of the historical sources. Rather than define the late colonial Franciscan support of miraculous images as a break from sixteenth-century restraint, the current project chooses instead to understand how the Order's earliest strategies concerning images and their use set the stage for the future investment in numinous objects.|The dissertation interrogates the first Franciscan written accounts and activities that advanced the reputation of numinous, sacred objects and the Order's official attachment to sanctuary sites. Iconophilic praxis is examined in relationship to the onslaught of challenges posed by mendicant rivals--the Jesuits chief among them--and the Spanish Crown's own seventeenth-century strategy of transferring economic, religious, and political clout from monastic centers to the secular Church. The Crown's sharp and unforgiving policies would greatly intensify in the eighteenth century and culminate in the nineteenth. The same period, however, sees the establishment of the Franciscan missionary colleges of Propaganda Fide.|For Franciscan friars working under the banner of Propaganda Fide, spiritual reparation, religious renovation, and moral restitution formed a lexicon aimed at sustaining long-term projects of instauration. The late colonial promotion of sacred images became crucial to a buoyant Franciscan ontology: miraculous images reconverted lapsed communities, spiritually renovated ailing cities, battled Devils in Christian bodies, and announced mendicant piety and sanctity. Missionaries carefully sought to create and control a local cult of images in areas such as Queretaro, Zacatecas, Upper California, and Texas. The symbiotic relationship between the eighteenth-century missionary enterprise and the miraculous icon is most apparent in the history of a Marian icon from el Pueblito (Queretaro). Although the image's central iconography originates in a Rubens oil-sketch celebrating the Immaculate Conception, the visual theme receives the most exposure in the Franciscan strongholds of central New Spain where it comes to be strictly identified with the Order's conversion efforts. Thus, what began as an illustration of a controversial doctrine and its royal support in the Spanish Netherlands became, in Spanish America, a laudatory statement on the Franciscan missionary project. Yet the microhistory of the Virgin of el Pueblito also demonstrates the friars' strategy for the transformation of an illustration into a religious presence; in the town of el Pueblito, the Marian sculpture became an instrument capable of conversion, a holy image, and an object of veneration. With the story of el Pueblito, the dissertation enters into a more historical discussion of the status of images in the New World and interrogates the process through which an image came not only to symbolize something new, but to do something different.",,,English

A six-step process followed the completion of the collection of the data. The six steps are as follows: Initial engagement, Immersion into the topic and question, Incubation, Illumination, Explication, and Creative synthesis. All of these steps are interconnected by means of dialogue.|A special effort of comparing and sharing the opinions of the founding members, a true process of triangulation and member checking, functioned as a guarantee of the rigor and trustworthiness of the study (Moustakas, 1994). The researcher was nondirective and permissive in the dialogues and interviews. ||Major Findings: First, the set of characteristics described in the section A New Rogers-Freire-Goleman Paradigm of this study and attributed to the Magister Institute’s leadership style were substantiated by the research participants in their interviews and post-interviews conversations and dialogues with the researcher. It was the unanimous perception of all the members that this was a “group or team of equals” or a “consensus management group.” These two expressions seemed to convey in their minds that MI group reached the highest level of person-centeredness and attained an ideal form of personal and group consensus management. Secondly, the short-term goal of collaboration with the S. J. was challenged and a new concept of relationship with the Jesuits was embraced by most of the group members. Thirdly, the method employed has shown its usefulness to study action groups in a short period of time. Time and cost are two factors recommending this method. Fourthly, the highlighted imbedded sense of mission of the founding members made their unity and common vision a viable alternative. Finally, the heuristic phenomenologic method employed to study this complex and intricate religious organization facilitated its global comprehension while shedding light to understand the uniqueness and otherness of several of its key components.",,,English

The year 1540 coincides with the beginning of the Society of Jesus and their entrance into the missionary field alongside the Franciscan and Dominican missionary orders, all subsets of the Roman Catholic Church. The Jesuits' practice of first establishing respect, then influence, and eventually working for religious conversion proved far more effective than the relatively forceful tack taken by Dominican and Franciscan missionaries. While highly successful, Jesuit missionary techniques sufficiently clashed with the Franciscan and Dominican approaches to arouse the unwelcome interest of several papal inquiries, and contributed in large part to the dissolution of the Society in 1773. Within this era, three regions stand out as most valuable for their historical and biographical abundance, as well as their evolving political structures. India, Japan, and China all experienced significant missionary activity by different Catholic orders while their political systems evolved from feudal to national incarnations. Further, there was no dearth of European economic and political interest in these regions, creating a controversial social backdrop to missionary efforts very similar to that experienced by modern U.S. special operations personnel. Finally, the political, cultural and ideological characteristics are sufficiently varied between regions to permit distillation of a useful political and social influence heuristic applicable in a wide variety of special operations circumstances. The author examines the most successful Jesuit practices, creates a general model of their approach, and draws parallels to similar contemporary challenges to special operations forces.",,,English

One of theology's most important functions is to furnish people with ways of perceiving these divine intimations in their concrete lives and relationships. Orientation to transcendental mystery is the sine qua non for initiation into faith. Theology must therefore lead people more deeply into the mystery of everyday existence as a preparation for the Christian life. At the same time, theology aims at expounding Christian teaching in as clear and intelligible a manner as possible. Theology accomplishes this by adapting its modes of presenting doctrine to the needs and capabilities of its addressees. This two-fold responsibility is properly understood as theology's mystagogical task. This dissertation argues that film is a crucial reference point for mystagogy--a locus mystagogicus. Film interprets human experience in ways conceptual theology cannot. It is thus a rich source for theological reflection. Theology is also an indispensable resource for film interpretation and a natural dialogue partner since it seeks to disclose the deepest dimensions of existence. More importantly, film needs theology as the hermeneutic that formally interprets religious experience--something that many human beings only vaguely sense, often misunderstand, and can easily misrepresent. With the help of film experts, theology can turn its discerning eyes to the stories and images of film and present viewers with a unique language by which they can articulate a response to their film experience. Film thus requires theology to bear witness to its artistry when it does succeed in opening people in wonder and humility to the ever-greater God. This dissertation in Catholic systematic theology investigates the theoretical and practical conditions of possibility for film as a locus for and of mystagogy. The question that it attempts to clarify is the extent to which Karl Rahner's fundamental theology provides an apposite and needed model for the way Catholic theology relates to film. There are three basic goals: (1) to outline existing ecclesial and theological foundations for a Catholic theology of film by way of a survey of magisterial documents on cinema and the writings of individual Catholic theologians and film scholars; (2) to provide greater theological grounding for Catholic approaches to film by developing the model that film is a locus mystagogicus on the basis of Rahner's transcendental method, creative retrieval of ancient mystagogy, and theological aesthetics; and (3) to test the viability and vitality of this model by way of analysis of the film Babette's Feast.",,,English

It shows how the English Crown gradually learnt to use the printed book as a political instrument. After a first period during which the authorities strove to master the polemical printed text, they made use of it in order to fight against the Jesuits coming from France as well as to promote the king of Navarre as a Protestant hero. Yet, Henri IV's recantation put an end to the English passion for Huguenot victories, even though they remained interested in French history books. James Stuart's coming to the throne in 1603, along with their experience of the previous thirty years, enabled English printers to compete with the new king for the spreading of royal treatises, in England as well as in Europe.",,,French

Working in the aftermath of the Council of Trent, these priests sought to establish a Roman Catholic identity for their parishioners while living and working in the midst of Protestants, Anabaptists, Hussites, and Jews. Anabaptists in particular found patronage under local Moravian lords willing to tolerate them for a number of reasons, including economic utility and personal conviction. An examination of the writings of Erhard and Fischer reveals a number of issues that permeated the course of Catholic counter-reform in this area of confessional pluralism. For in the absence of support from their overlords, these priests had to rely heavily on persuasive strategies in their published polemics. They drew upon a genealogy of heresy grounded in the history of the Roman Church, sought to trouble the|consciences of those lords who tolerated confessional pluralism in their domains, and promoted public Roman Catholic ritual practices, especially Eucharistic devotion through the annual Feast of Corpus Christi. Their work serves as an excellent point of departure for understanding how representatives of the Roman Church approached the problem of heresy in the Holy Roman Empire in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, especially in regions where the Church lacked the full support of local and regional secular authorities.",,,English

Through an online quantitative survey of administrators in centers of teaching and learning at Jesuit colleges and universities in the United States, this study examined the extent to which administrators are making available and appropriating Ignatian pedagogy and the contributions it might make to the current pedagogical literature for Jesuit higher education. It explored whether similar components within Ignatian pedagogy are fostered through other pedagogical approaches including, John Dewey's philosophy of education, critical pedagogy, feminist pedagogy, Service-Learning, adult learning theory, and Fink's taxonomy of significant learning. Results indicate the majority of administrators are very familiar with, and offer programs on, Ignatian pedagogy. They unanimously care for the Jesuit mission and nearly all believe in providing pedagogical resources that foster the Jesuit mission. The literature review identified connections between Ignatian pedagogy and several pedagogical approaches while administrators' made the majority of connections between Ignatian pedagogy and Service-Learning and Adult Learning. More than three-fourths administrators promote three Ignatian teaching methodological elements, Context, Experience, and Reflection, while more than one-half promote the element Action. Greater than two-thirds provide programs that foster the development of the whole person, service to others, and social justicecore Jesuit values. Further, more than three-fourths of Center administrators believe Ignatian pedagogy is viable for higher education. These results positively affirm the validity and viability of Ignatian pedagogy, a nearly 500 year-old Jesuit educational tradition and way of proceeding, in light of 21st century higher education pedagogical knowledge and practices. Recommendations include: increasing faculty knowledge of, accessibility to, and opportunities for critique and debate of, Ignatian pedagogy; expanding student evaluation to incorporate maturation and moral growth; and expanding pedagogical practices to include spiritual development. Other recommendations include mission development through pedagogical development, and formally requiring lay faculty, staff, and administrators to take ownership of, and responsibility for, fostering the Jesuit mission.",,,English

He went on to be ordained a Jesuit priest and to make an outstanding contribution to the musical life of the institutions he lived and taught in, notably the English College at Saint-Omer, in Spanish Flanders. Poole's output will be shown to be of importance in the history of seventeenth-century instrumental music, especially in the context of the development of the sonata in England and division-viol music in Europe. His music has not been collected, catalogued or studied before, and this thesis presents it against the backdrop of several generations of English musicians who spent all or part of their working lives abroad. The significance of migrant musicians is often neglected by comparison with that of native musicians, perhaps because the latter fit our perceptions of national styles better, and this thesis goes some way towards appraising that contribution. The bass viol, or the 'Brittanica Chelys' in the words of the expatriate Latin poet Dr John Alban Gibbes, was an instrument with strong Catholic and Royalist resonances in England, and extemporising divisions on it became in post- Thirty- Y ears-War Europe a quintessentially English art, as will be shown in chapter one. Chapter two presents as full a biographical account as is possible at present, and chapter three considers all extant sources of Poole's music, exploring how his works made their way to the exiled court at Saint-Germain-en-Laye, the library of Phillip Falle, the viol-playing circle of William Noble in Oxford, and elsewhere in England. This thesis contains therefore a significant contribution to our understanding of the history of English Jesuit music, the court of James Il, and the circulation of Continental music in Restoration England. Chapter four is a stylistic discussion of the music, its influences and reception, and the appendix consists of a thematic index of Poole's works.",,,English

The traits of love illustrated in the first part of the encyclical have been developed within a model of education enriched by the contributions of contemporary scholars as Bernard Lonergan (philosophy of education), Martin D'Arcy (anthropology), Paulo Freire (political education), Avery Dulles (theology) and Franco Imoda (psychology). Benedict XVI's notion of love-caritas-agape draws together significant themes of Ratzinger's thought (communio, faith-reason, ethics of witnesses, etc.) and is developed in his further papal teaching. According to Benedict XVI, love can be an essential animating force of Catholic education within the nature and mission of the Church; it is a form of evangelization, an authentic answer to the current educational emergency. ^ Moreover, Catholic education is a Church work of charity and mercy. According to Benedict XVI, this emphasis on love and its educational consequences should make the development Catholic education a priority for the pastoral programs of bishops and for the agenda of international leaders.|The findings of 'elite interviews' to international leaders of Catholic education completed this investigation revealing a generic perception of the potentiality of Benedict XVI's teaching about love as well as of the way he is challenging Catholic institutions to answer the current educational emergency. ^ International leaders of Catholic education are open to discuss these issues (because of their loyalty to the Church as institution), even if they show a general perception of how Benedict XVI's emphasis on love could challenge Catholic education. ^",,,English

Deep within its theological roots were embedded two parallel streams of thought. One was the indigenous collective point of view regarding human sacrifice as perceived by the Náhua people of Mesoamerica, and the other was the western Christian perspective on the soteriological significance of atonement. This dissertation is an analysis of the theological tension that existed between these two dialectical points of view, and an explication of how this dialectical tension is resolved through Hans Urs von Balthasar's theology of Theo-Drama and Josiah Royce's notion of triadic relationships. I argue that the Passion Drama of Christ at the San Fernando Cathedral brings Von Balthasar's Theo-Drama to a theatrical expression and offers a dramatic Roycean interpretant which I call a theo-catharsis in which the Náhua and Western perspectives which would split a community apart instead become interpreted into a Beloved Community.",,,English

The metaphors with which awe can be described therefore never fully define what it feels like to be affected by awe: awe is motion, elevation, lightness, and flight. As experience, awe constitutes a shattering jolt that brings about a fundamental and revelatory re-conception of life: a full awareness of the invisible life, filled, ""in a flash"", to the brim. This study explores awe’s coming to poetical givenness in the poetry of Gerard Manley Hopkins by taking into consideration experiential and existential as well as epistemological concerns. A phenomenological approach, for instance Edmund Husserl’s epochetic method and Michel Henry’s concept of the invisible, helps illuminate Hopkins’s poetics; a poetics which solicits a special focus precisely on awe in its various aspects. Hopkins’s poetry has a unique ability to constitute a crossing where in-depth feelings and forces of the wondrous in the striking aspects of awe can be vocalised. The focus on the phenomenon of awe’s poetical appearing therefore allows for a consideration of this life-transforming jolt as an irresistible force reverberating throughout Hopkins’s work and as such allows us to explore the experience of invisible life that lies at the heart of the possibility of conversion as a fundamental change of world-view.",,,English

Cette thèse est consacrée aux pratiques musicales et de danses en usage dans ce théâtre collégien. À l'issue d'une recension des représentations (établissement d'un catalogue des représentations et d'un répertoire de sources) et d'une reconstitution de plusieurs fragments musicaux, ce travail envisage l'inscription des scènes collégiennes dans l'espace artistique de la capitale, tout en les replaçant dans les usages pédagogiques de chaque établissement. Les conditions de ces représentations, leur publicité et les nombreux écrits qu'elles génèrent, enfin les acteurs et les milieux professionnels impliqués dans ces spectacles, sont successivement étudiés. La deuxième partie de la thèse est consacrée à un genre remarquable par sa continuité et son prestige, le ballet, l'élément le plus marquant et le plus polémique des spectacles de collège depuis le milieu du XVIIe siècle.

This thesis studies musical practices and dances as part of these performances. A complete catalog of the performances and the preserved sources along with a reconstruction of musical fragments gives an image of the artistic life in these pedagogical institutions in particular and in the Parisian theatrical context of the period. The specific conditions for these performances, the numerous publications (programmes, commentaries, manuscripts, posters, etc.), the actors and their professional environment have been studied. The ballet, with its continuity and prestige, is the subject of the 2nd part of this work. Since the mid-17th century, it holds an important and polemic position within the theatrical performance. The particularities of the college ballet and its century-long evolution are analyzed.

The phenomenology of performing spiritual exercises in clinical pastoral care leads to a systematic theology for pastoral ministry. It integrates psychological and theological conscientization, transforming the participants through the self-emptying self-giving dynamism of radical love, even for the enemy. The love for God and neighbor provides a communal ecclesial space of encounter and conversation for all to share with the Spirit.

This study examines the creation and change of dominant historical memories at four British palaces and ancestral homes. Through the close analysis of a variety of guidebooks beginning in the eighteenth century as well as other promotional materials such as websites and films, this study looks at which historical memories are emphasized for visitors and the reasons for these dominant memories. Place theorists such as Yi-Fu Tuan and Michel de Certeau as well as memory theorists such as Maurice Halbwachs, Pierre Nora, and Eric Hobsbawm have influenced the analysis of the project's sources. This inquiry focuses on four palaces: Hampton Court Palace outside London; Edinburgh Castle in the heart of Edinburgh, Scotland; Cardiff Castle in Cardiff, Wales; and Chatsworth House in Devonshire, England. The Victorians have played a large role in determining dominant memories at these sites through their interest in and focus on both the medieval period and objects in the home. Dominant memories discussed focus on the Tudors, medieval military importance, the myth and imagining of the Victorian medieval, the Regency period of Jane Austen, and elite family-home relationships.

F., 1904–1984","This dissertation articulates a critical social theory that is sympathetic to the emancipatory project of modernity. It argues that Western rationality should not be overcome but be rehabilitated, that modernism should not be abandoned but be redeemed, that the isolated, self-centered, disembodied Cartesian cogito should be rejected to allow the emergence of a decentered self, and that the objectified world of science should be repudiated to realize a lifeworld that is constituted by common meaning. It sees the possibility of completing the unfinished project of human liberation through a systematic retrieval and reformulation of the conceptual foundations of modernity, namely, selfhood, rationality, and society, which will form the bases for a radical critique and overcoming of the phenomena of alienation, domination, and colonization in late capitalism.|Lonergan and Habermas use two different paradigms in dealing with modernism. I argue that Habermas's paradigm of communicative action, which he develops from his critique and rejection of the philosophy of the subject, is based on a wrong understanding of the concept of consciousness as necessarily implying instrumentalism. This basic paradigmatic problem in Habermas leads to a neglect of the individual self, a one-sided conception of reason as merely linguistically constituted, and an excessively linguistic concept of the lifeworld that ignores the non-linguistic elements of social life. By complementing Habermas's communicative approach with Lonergan's paradigm of self-appropriation, we can recover a more comprehensive concept of selfhood that is embodied, situated, communicative, intersubjective, free, critical, responsible, and responsive to the transcendental precepts and validity claims. The Lonerganian reconstruction of Habermas's communicative rationality also leads to the recovery of reason that is both cognitively and linguistically constituted, critical, evidential, emancipatory, attentive, intelligent, reasonable, and responsible. Our reconstructive project also gives way to a concept of lifeworld that is both linguistic and perceptual.|The convergence of the two paradigms--communication and self-appropriation--is a new approach to modernity which we call ""new modernism."" The concept of ""new modernism"" shows that the emancipatory project of modernity can be completed through self-appropriation of the different levels of one's conscious intentionality in order to give way to a cognitive, communicative praxis that leads to truth, freedom, and justice. This process demands a further enlightenment, or what Lonergan calls Second Enlightenment, geared towards the restoration of meaning, empowerment, and emancipation through intellectual, moral, and affective conversion.",,,English

Lonergan's trinitarian theology as it pertains to a systematic understanding of religious diversity. Renewed interest in trinitarian doctrine as the central Christian mystery with practical implications for theology and praxis as well as the key reality and concept in a coherent and ordered understanding of the Christian faith connects this doctrine with many areas of theology. In the current context of pluralism as fact, trinitarian theology provides the heuristic and hermeneutic to understand and appropriate the meaning of religious diversity in the life of the Church.|This dissertation is a systematic approach to the question of religious diversity. Thus, it presumes and affirms conciliar dogma (the Nicea-Constantinopolitan Creed) and theological doctrines (the psychological analogy for the Trinity). The ""unified field structure"" proposed by Robert M. Doran, which is comprised of Lonergan's four-point hypothesis coupled with a theory of history, serves as the theological framework and foundation toward an understanding of religious diversity that is open to and anticipates new developments that are bound to occur through the ongoing conversations between the world's religions.|I argue that a Lonerganian-trinitarian approach will result in a new set of questions elicited by the context of religious diversity different from the current debates circumscribed by Christocentric, ecclesiological and soteriological concerns. Such an approach will result in a shift in discourse from causality to that of meaning and a concomitant movement from the metaphysical language and categories of a theoretical theology to the language and categories of a methodical theology derived from intentionality analysis.|Lonergan‟s trinitarian thought and analysis of human development from above downward that are explored in this dissertation are two significant areas that remain underexploited and which, I believe, have great potential for any theological enterprise.

Hans Urs von Balthasar (1905–1988), en proposant sa Dramatique divine (1973–1983) éclaire, par la méditation du théâtre comme genre littéraire et comme performance en scène, l'originalité propre à l'intelligence chrétienne du temps décisif , le temps de la vie du Christ, temps définitif accompli et modèle de la temporalité chrétienne. Le temps et l'histoire sont bien développés selon le shéma linéaire d'un avant et d'un après Jésus-Christ. Mais ils sont également conçus comme disposés autour du centre. A la croisée d'un temps mesuré par le chronomètre et d'un temps qualifié par l'apparition et la rencontre des personnes, la représentation théâtrale donne de comprendre la validité esthétique, dramatique et théologique d'une conception à la fois linéaire et concentrique du temps et de l'histoire.| |How do we manage to grasp that the historical coming of the word-made-flesh, Jesus of Nazareth, recapitulates everything that we mean by a ""theology of history?"" This includes the historical becoming of humanity, the originality and absolute character of the christian phenomenon, the christian meaning of time, the harmonious relation between the two Testaments, the meaning of the ""time of the Church"", the fulfillment of humanity in history, christian hope and the final destiny of all creatures. For christians, Jesus Christ, even though he belongs to the past, remains the key to the development of all human history. Can such an affirmation be more than an arbitrary opinion without any reasonable basis? However, if this convictions is not absurd, then it has implications for the way we understand the evolution of epochs and of historical periods. It opens un a concrete way to experience time, including the time of the day-to-day, time measured by clocks and calendars. Hans Urs von Balthasar (1905–1988) in presenting his Theo-Drama (1973–1983), by using the meditation of theatre as literary genre and as dramatic performance, clarifies the originality that is specific to the decisive christian understanding of time - the time of the life of Christ : a time definitive and fulfilled that is the model for a christian understandingof time. Time and history are clearly developed following the linear schema of before and after Jesus Christ but they are also envisaged as arranged around Christ as center. At the crossroads of chronometrical time and time as the appearance and encounter of persons, the theatrical representation allows us to understand the aesthetic, dramatic and theological value of von Balthasar's conception of time and of history that is at once both linear and concentric.",,,French

His claim to a legitimate voice lies in the tremendous amount of erudite knowledge he accumulated over the years, on many different subjects, and his classical education. Major focus is on his pristine awareness of the Anglo-Saxons and their language of Old English. Hopkins's unique style of writing poetry and his contribution to Victorian philology is highlighted. The work also deals, in some degree, with his mental state at various periods in his life, and attempts to disclose an overcoming of the anguish and depression evident in the poems.

In accordance with the wishes of the Holy See, the Jesuits intend to establish the Catholic Churches of the Orient and also to fight against protestant missions. After 1850 they also got France's support; it provided the mission with a mean for extending its influence in the Orient. In Syria, the Jesuits settled in Mont-Lebanon, then in Beirut and Saida. Closely scrutinized by the oriental clergy, subjected to the demands of their protectors (pashas, consuls, emirs) they particularly devoted themselves to teaching and to the spiritual care of Catholics living near their residences and from 1860 they nearly gave up all apostolate to the other Christians or Muslims of the Orient. At the end of the 19th century, many clerics of the oriental Catholic Churches had graduated from Ghazir's college-seminary which the Jesuits opened in 1846. Through the creation of communities of nuns who devoted themselves to the girls' education, the Jesuits had a part in the transformation of the women's role in the Oriental society. En 1831, la Compagnie de Jésus envoie trois missionnaires en Syrie ottomane. Conformément aux voeux du Saint-Siège, les jésuites entendent affermir les Eglises catholiques orientales et lutter contre les missions protestantes.

Educators have promoted these practices as transformative experiences that encourage students to reflect critically on the world and their experience within it and to develop habits of engaged citizenship that promote sustained commitment to a more just and equitable society. The purpose of this qualitative inquiry is to interrogate and report findings for four key questions: How do college students make meaning of their service-learning experiences? How do service-learning experiences combine with other course activities and prior experiences and personal background to affect college students' attitudes about race and social justice? How do college students communicate what they are learning and the meaning they are making from service-learning experiences? What are the positive and negative effects of service-learning on the development of knowledge, skills, and attitudes about race and social justice for college students from racially and socioeconomically privileged groups? These questions are examined in the context of service-learning assigned as part of an introductory course on schooling in a diverse society within a teacher education program at an urban, Catholic, Jesuit university. Four case study narratives are presented to illustrate the experiences and meaning-making processes of students with racial and socioeconomic privilege. Also presented are findings regarding factors in five key areas across cases that influence service-learning experiences and outcomes: students' family relationships, identity development, and background; previous experiences with and exposure to diversity, poverty, and community service; current perceptions and expectations regarding race, poverty, and the role of service; service site environment, activities, and relationships; and the connection of service-learning to the course content, instructor, and teaching methods. Finally, implications are discussed for service-learning and teacher education programs, including student development perspectives, course design, service site selection, realistic expectations for courses and students, and the types of prolonged experience and cross-cultural engagement that lead students to develop a commitment to multicultural education and an ethos of teaching for social justice.",,,English

F., 1904–1984","It has been long known that groups of adults learn and enact their learning in certain ways; what is little known is how groups learn and how they develop in cognitive complexity. This dissertation proposes a theory of group cognitive development by arguing that intentional adult groups are complex and dynamic, and that they have the potential to evolve over time. Groups are complex in that they are made up of individuals within different orders of consciousness (Kegan), and they are dynamic in that different orders of consciousness interact and conflict (Lonergan) during the formation and enactment of group vision, values, and procedures. Dynamic complexity theory of group development as it is referred to in this study is grounded in Robert Kegan's constructive developmental theory and in Bernard Lonergan's transcendental method. While both Kegan and Lonergan attend to the growth of individuals, their theories are adapted to groups in order to understand the cognitive complexity of groups, intragroup and intergroup conflict, and the mental complexity of leader curriculum. This theory is applied to two case studies, one from antiquity in the case of the first century Corinthian community engaged in conflict with its founder, St. Paul, and in one contemporary study of American Catholic parishioners engaged in contentious dialogue with diocesan leaders from 1994 to 2004. The parish groups experienced a series of dialogues during a ten year period over the issues of parish restructuring and the priest sexual abuse crisis yielding cumulative and progressive changes in perspective-taking, responsibility-taking, and in group capacity to respond to and engage local and institutional authority figures. Group development is observed against a pedagogical backdrop that represents a mismatch between group complexity and leader expectations. In Corinth, Paul's curriculum was significantly beyond the mental capacity of the community. In the case of Catholic parishioners the ...",,,English

Based on a thorough and unpublished analysis of various archive sources, my thesis approaches the musical phenomenon of the everyday life of fathers and students, as well as of the magnificence of ceremonies, confronting the realities of these manifestations with the official rules and ordinances of the order regarding music. Four areas of research have been defined: 1. Music in Jesuit churches; 2. Edifying through singing: spriritual canticles; 3. Training and musical practices in colleges and boarding schools; 4. Musician companions. In addition, this study examines the life and works of the jesuit composer Louis le Quoynte (1652–1717), apprehends the realities of his musical activity within the Company, and finally looks into his productions (psalms, motets, spiritual canticles) in the musical landscape of this period.||Notre recherche entend comprendre les modalités du rapport des jésuites à la musique dans les provinces gallo- et flandro-belges – sur le territoire des Pays-Bas méridionaux et de la Principauté de Liège - de la seconde moitié du XVIe siècle à la suppression de la Compagnie en 1773.

Deeply influenced in his early years by such figures as Cardinal Mercier or Father Lagrange, he resigned from Chief editor of Revue apologétique when an article opposed to l'Action française was denied publication. As a Thomist theologian, he got involved in Patristic studies, but also urged Catholic Action seminars to bring together Faith and Science, and as a Christian philosopher, fought beside Blondel for recognition. Singled out by Mgr Saliège during a Social Week session, he became Dean of the Catholic Institute in Toulouse in 1932, teaching theology too, until he resigned in 1964. As he implemented Deus Scientiarum Dominus, he made extensions in the Catholic Institute and launched theology courses for lay students; besides, in the 1930ies, he opened it to persecuted people or to opponents of fascist regimes. He was active in movements of spiritual or intellectual resistance to Nazism or to French Vichy government. In 1944, he was taken to a concentration camp. From 1945 onward, he became a staunch advocate of French theologians like de Lubac or Teilhard, spreading information on the latter's ground-breaking theories.

The emergence of seventeenth-century Jesuit theatre innovations in eighteenth-century Benedictine and Augustinian school theatrical productions validates this conclusion and reveals a conduit of influence not previously articulated. While previous comparisons of Jesuit theatre main title dramas and Oratorian oratorios do not reveal a relationship, a comparative examination of the musical prologues and choruses performed within Jesuit theatrical productions and the musical works performed in the services of the Congregation of the Oratory over the period c.1550–c.1660 shows a parallel progression of development; the development of the oratorio in the oratories of the Congregation is a further demonstration of Jesuit influence during this time period. The friendship of Ignatius Loyola and Filippo Neri matured into a close relationship between the musical activities of the Society of Jesus and the Congregation of the Oratory during the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. The simultaneous development of the Jesuit school theatre independent prologue and chorus and the Congregation of the Oratory oratorio is one of the results of this relationship. The sacred musical works in Jesuit school theatrical productions and the services of the Congregation follow the same pathway of development and exhibit equivalent characteristics. A formal declaration restricting performance language in the Oratorian services caused the two repertoires to diverge c.1620–c.1630. A comparison of independent Jesuit theatre prologues and choruses and the oratorios performed during the services of the Congregation of the Oratory c.1640–c.1660 reveals that these two bodies of work are distinguishable from each other only by the language of the text.",,,English

Using museum collections of archaeological artifacts and historical sources, the goal of my research is threefold: to update the data on Christian-themed artifacts found at Seneca sites, to develop a more cohesive portrait of Iroquoian spirituality, and to examine whether the material and historical records present a case for religious syncretism. My updated enumeration of Jesuit-style finger rings takes into consideration current excavations, and has more than doubled since Alice Wood's 1974 study. By contrast, the religious medals, crosses and crucifixes found on Seneca territory have never been analyzed until now. Research on the religious medals was aided by the Clark Manuscript, compiled from 1894–1902 by General John S. Clark (1823–1912). Overall, my research decisively concludes that Christian-themed artifacts occur both within and outside of the Jesuit missionary period.",,,English

Likewise, many of these nonfiction accounts are written from a distinctly polarized place leaning either to science or faith. In this thesis, I mix research and history with memoir and a sense of poetry to explore my personal experience with this conflict. At its outset, I hoped for this project to capture my struggle as an orthodox member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS) in dealing with the questions my own sense of logic provided that institution. This goal was achieved in part. However, by the end of the project I had also captured a narrative exploration of my experience leaving the LDS Church and learning, instead of trusting the authority provided by a structure of orthodoxy, to feel comfortable trusting my own sense of reason. The first chapter captures my initial struggle with acknowledging questions within a religious structure. This is accomplished, in part, by merging the personal narrative with a researched account of French priest and paleontologist Pierre Teilhard de Chardin. I show both his struggle with questions and faith, and my desire to lean on his example as someone who acknowledged question without leaving his faith--in Chardin's case the Catholic Church. The second chapter, again following this pattern of mixing research with memoir, explores the feelings of exile I had during the time while I was still an orthodox member of the LDS church. This personal narrative is woven into several historical and literary accounts of exile. In the third chapter, I struggle with the question of what to do with the spiritual experiences I had during my time in the LDS Church after having separated myself from that institution. The short fourth chapter takes a strictly narrative line as I address my spiritual and mental outlook upon the completion of this project.",,,English

Son esthétique dramatique privilégie la dimension culturelle par rapport aux intentions édifiantes : fragilité des grandeurs, opposition entre sagesse et démesure. Relevant, par son écriture dans le cadre d'un collège jésuite, d'un théâtre pédagogique spectaculaire, elle s'inscrit dans une tradition encore récente d'un théâtre moral destiné à la représentation. Notre analyse étudie comment, en empruntant sujets et forme littéraire à la culture antique, ce Père jésuite, professeur de rhétorique, a composé ce corpus dans la tradition du théâtre humaniste, alliant tragédie et histoire, dans une dimension rhétorique qui répond aux exigences de l'enseignement jésuite.Bien qu'éditées en 2000 par R.

His aesthetics privileges the cultural dimension compared to the edifying intentions : fragility of splendours, opposition between moderation and excessiveness. Concerning the spectacular teaching theatre because written in the Jesuit colleges, it also falls under a still recent tradition of a moral theatre intended for the representation. We study how this Jesuit Father, who taught rhetoric, took inspiration from topics and literary form to the ancient culture, and composed this corpus in the tradition of humanistic theatre, by combining tragedy with history, in rhetorical dimension which fulfils the requirements of Jesuit pedagogy. Although published by R. Rieks (Petrus Mussonius, Tragoediae, Peter Lang, Frankfurt am Main, 2000), these tragedies have never been translated, their ancient sources never thoroughly analysed, and their conditions of writing and performing never studied ; all these reasons justify this work about reception of historical figures and literary styles of Antiquity, under rhetoric influence.",,,French

La théologie s'expose à une constante tension : en effet, elle ne doit sacrifier un des deux aspects au profit de l'autre. Aussi doit-elle accorder une place aux sciences humaines et naturelles sans perdre sa spécificité. Le lieu originel de la théologie serait alors l'Alliance nouvelle et éternelle que Dieu a conclue avec son peuple dans le Christ : toute la réalité humaine y trouve sa place, se dirigeant vers son accomplissement eschatologique. La théologie s'enracine donc dans la spiritualité comme expérience de l'Alliance en même temps qu'elle approfondit la connaissance de celle-ci à travers le mouvement continu d'une pensée qui rend compte du rapport des deux pôles en relation, Dieu et son peuple.

Theology experiences a constant tension as it mustn't sacrifice either one of the two aspects: in fact, it has to take into account the contribution of the human and natural sciences without losing its own specificity. The original place of theology would be the new and everlasting covenant, into which God entered with his people in Christ: all human reality finds its due place in it, moving towards its eschatological perfection. Thus theology is rooted in spirituality as the experience of the covenant, of which it deepens the knowledge as a continuous reasoning moving around the two poles that are in constant relation: God and his people. Dedicated to the relationship spirituality has respectively with the Bible, dogma, eschatology, literature and sciences, the five parts of this thesis explore this elliptical movement of theological reasoning and pay special attention to interdisciplinary questions",,,French

The thesis includes a very brief historical account of the concept of analogy in philosophical and theological metaphysics, but has for its real starting point the exclamation of Karl Barth that the analogia entis is ""the invention of the Antichrist."" After exploring Barth's reasons for reacting so strongly to the doctrine, I discuss some of Barth's Catholic interlocutors' attempts to resolve the dispute. Then I attend to the question of form of thought, or Denkform, a term coined by Hans Urs von Balthasar in his study The Theology of Karl Barth: Exposition and Interpretation to express ""styles of truth"" in Catholic theology. Finally, I consider the original proposal for the analogia entis by Erich Przywara. My conclusion is that the analogia entis exceeds the requirements for openness set by Balthasar for a Catholic form of thought, and that it, as an essentially open metaphysics, testifies to the mystical end of finitude.",Based in Centrum för teologi och religionsvetenskap.,,English

F., 1904–1984","This dissertation explores Bernard Lonergan's notion of emergent probability as a world process which explains the intelligibility of natural evolution, human history and the human cognitional structure. It is the immanent intelligibility of the order in which ideas, insights, bias, events, things, schemes, institutions, nations exist or occur, reoccur, survive or seize to reoccur. Therefore, it is a worldview that envisions conditioned series of schemes of recurrences, their progressive, decline, reversal and defensive cycles, and their respective possibilities, probabilities, and actualities of emergence and survival.|The focus of this dissertation is not on emergent probability in nature, but on that of human cooperation based on conditioned series of schemes of recurrence of insight and bias with respect to the levels of operations. Just as human beings have a desire to know, they also have a desire to make, to create, to invent, to innovate and remake, re-create, reinvent, re-innovate tools, thereby accumulating insights and establishing higher viewpoints for further knowing, making and remaking. This desire to make and the pattern of technological experience presupposes the levels of operations: technology, economy, society, politics, and religion. These levels are interlocked in a complementary and interdependent operative scheme.|Man is most fundamentally technological. Technology is the first level of operations, a good of order, and the texture of civilization that clearly depict the recurrent schemes of human direct and inverse insights in relation to progress; dramatic, individual, group and general biases, and perverse inverse insight in relation to decline. Inasmuch as insight leads to the propagation of one wheel of progress, it also devises the defensive cycles that sustain its existence, through falsification of history, rationalization of sin and initiation of the “order of evil” and social surd.|In this dissertation, computer information system is a key illustration of Lonergan's notion of emergent probability. If information is a component of emergent probability, then information systems should aim at the actualization of insight as information. The emergence of information systems suggests the possibility of thinking machines, given that what is possible may become probable, and what is probable soon or later becomes actual. The assumption that thinking machines are actual and information as insight is not a bias may lead to the emergence of the algorithmic human being- a human being exiled from the orbits of authentic cognitional process. Insight is primary in the sustainability of self-corrective process of human cooperation and the creative integration of the levels of operations.|A possible implementation of an understanding of general notion of emergent probability and the primacy of insight as information can illuminate an understanding of the historical processes of the wheel of progress and defensive cycles operative in the African context. The good of order and the order of evil are initiated by power, liberty, insight or bias and the alteration of the first level of operation and the subsequent conditioned series of schemes of recurrence of human operations and cooperation. Hence, creative appropriation and technological liberation, and cosmopolis constitute a viable solution to the development of Dynamic System Of Integrity and Authentication for understanding African history. Authentic development, the good of order without an accompanying order of evil within the worldview of emergent probability is not possible without the transcendental precepts of being attentive, being intelligent, being reasonable and being responsible. Again development is not possible without cosmopolis empowered by the theological virtues as the way to overcoming the problem of practicality of the common sense. And also, the infusion of God's habitual grace in the human statistical laws shifts the probabilities of emergence of the levels of operations. The God presupposed by emergent probability becomes a solution to the problem of evil, the order of evil and social surd. Given that no nation, people or country can develop or grow under the exploitation of its enemies and friends, therefore Africa's development and growth cannot be achieved without conversion to the understanding of things as recurrent, without authentic actualization of insight as information and the redirection of education systems to reflect the technological process, the political will for its adaptation and its defense.",,,English

Visamos, então, saber que elementos compõem essa ordem pedagógica quinhentista, pois tal ordem foi o tipo de discurso aplicado aos meninos indígenas durante sua educação. Como os jesuítas já recolhiam estudantes antes de vir para o Brasil, resolvemos panoramicamente saber como isso se dava. Denominaremos recolhimento dos meninos o dispositivo que materializou a prática educativa, própria do Ocidente. Tal dispositivo, retira esta tese do passado e a lança como problematizadora do presente, pois recolher e entregar são mais do que simples palavras, são discursos que ajudaram a construir, nesse caso, uma certa ordem pedagógica. Sobre isso, Foucault nos orienta. Afinal, por que razão, em meio a tantos descasos, entregamos e recolhemos as crianças às escolas? Sem meta explícita, esta tese acabou por questionar a noção de recolhimento como a primeira etapa da educação no Brasil. Porém, num exame mais apurado, descobrimos que o recolhimento é muito mais um dispositivo, uma prática, do que uma instituição em si. Se a escolarização brasileira só vai ganhar força no século XX, parece-nos, que o recolhimento foi uma prática que cotejou os primeiros anos desse século, fazendo, por exemplo, professores irem até as fazendas levantar o censo dos meninos para abrir escolas públicas. O recolhimento é a base discursiva da ordem pedagógica que atravessou a colônia brasileira e, quiçá, mesmo abandonado nos dias de hoje, ainda é utilizado pelos profissionais da área de educação, servindo, inclusive, como justificativa para barganhar as verbas públicas.||Its necessary to gain and retire the heathens sons: its a Jesuit axiom. That resulted in a great number of educational practices, conceiving a pedagogical order, applicable to the Tupinambas boys of Brazil-Colony. Then, we have aimed at knowing which elements made up this pedagogical order in the sixteenth century, for such an order was the kind of speech applied to the indigenous boys throughout the course of their education. Jesuits had already retired students before coming to Brazil, therefore we have decided to know it happened, why this became a western educational practice, removing this thesis from the past and throwing it to the present, because to retire and to give are move than simple words: they are speeches that have helped to set a pedagogical order up. On this we have Foucault guidance. After all, why we give and retire children to the schools? Without an explicit goal, this thesis has come to question the notion of retiring as the first stage of the education in Brazil. Yet, through a more refined analysis, we have found out that retiring is much more a device, a practice, than an institution. Insofar as Brazilian schooling will get strength during the twentieth century, we think that retiring made teachers go to farms to count boys in order to open public schools. Nowadays, retiring and guarding is still of use by the educations staff and may justify the bargain for public budget.",,,Portuguese

Ce territoire amazonien, situé au nord-Est du pays sur une zone frontalière disputée avec l'Équateur depuis les débuts de l'ère républicaine, fait l'objet d'un projet d'intégration à la sphère étatique et nationale. Colonisation interne par des populations paysannes métisses, exploration du sous-Sol préalable à l'élaboration de plans d'extraction minière, pénétration des pratiques narcotrafiquantes, institutionnalisation des oeuvres scolaire et médicale: de confin relégué à un statut d'invisibilité, le Haut Marañón devient alors un front de progression de la ""société englobante"", nationale puis internationale.

La thèse montre que loin de se limiter à une simple absorption du marginal par le national, cette rencontre a suscité l'intérêt d'une société civile encore en gestation, et précipité une remise en question partielle du paradigme historique de construction nationale, jusqu'alors sous-Tendu par des logiques socio-Raciales discriminantes et inégalitaires.||As an overlooked piece of Peru’s nation building process, the High Marañón region was mainly populated by indigenous, Awajún and Wampís populations until it was designated a Christian mission land in the middle of the XXth century. This Amazonian territory, located on the northeastern part of the country on the border with Ecuador, has been in diplomatic dispute since the early republican era. As a result, it became the focus of projects whose aim was to integrate the High Marañón into the nation and whose outcome was a number of new phenomena such as a process of “internal colonization” by peasants of mixed race, a series of subsoil explorations for mining extraction, and the institutionalization of activities related to education and health. From a forlorn land made invisible by the limitations of peruvian state apparatus, the High Marañón region became a battleground in the progression of global dynamics. This research aims to narrate the history of the “encounter” of two cultural areas, the indigenous one and the global one, from the arrival of the Jesuit mission in 1946 to the Baguazo event, so-Named after a bloody conflict between indigenous activists and police forces in the city of Bagua which took place in 2009. This research demonstrates that far from limiting itself to a mere absorption of a margin by a nation, this encounter has aroused the interest of Peruvian civil society, and partially called into question the historical nation-Building paradigm, in which socio-Racially biased logics have thusfar prevailed.",,,French

Os escritos espirituais de São João da Cruz são utilizados como fonte de descrição do fenômeno místico. Inicialmente, foi elaborada uma interpretação do conceito de espiritualidade a partir da Psicologia Analítica. Esta interpretação – baseada na teoria dos arquétipos e do inconsciente coletivo, com suas implicações biológicas – apontou o evolucionismo como uma chave hermenêutica relevante para a compreensão da espiritualidade e da mística. O evolucionismo, questão central também para Rahner enquanto dialética na qual a matéria progressivamente adquire as características do espírito (a autoconsciência e a abertura para o Mistério de Deus), mostrou-se, assim, um possível elo de ligação entre Jung e Rahner na análise da experiência mística. No desenvolvimento do trabalho foram trazidos temas centrais na obra de Jung (tais como o simbolismo do Si-mesmo, a conjunção dos opostos, a alquimia) e comparados com os conceitos metafísicos utilizados por Rahner. Esta conjugação do pensamento de ambos autores proporcionou a interpretação da mística do ponto de vista evolutivo, o que implicou em considerações nas áreas mais atuais da psicologia científica, especificamente a neuropsicologia. A tentativa de síntese de campos abrangentes do conhecimento que representa esta dissertação é algo importante para a situação atual da ciência, reconhecidamente fragmentária e dispersa em temas específicos. Este motivo justifica um trabalho nos moldes de um ensaio exploratório onde se destaquem em linhas gerais conexões essenciais e relevantes entre diversas teorias, conexões que tornem mais visíveis a natureza dos seus objetos e sua relação com a existência humana.||The dissertation aims to analyze the mystical experience using the theoretical framework of the Catholic theologian Karl Rahner and the psychologist Carl Gustav Jung, founder of Analytical Psychology. The spiritual writings of St. John of the Cross are used as a source of mystical description of the phenomenon. Initially, an interpretation of the concept of spirituality from Analytical Psychology was created. This interpretation based on the theory of archetypes and the collective unconscious with its biological implications pointed evolutionism as an important hermeneutical key to the understanding of spirituality and mysticism. Evolutionism, a central issue for Rahner while dialectics in which matter progressively acquires the characteristics of the spirit (self-awareness and openness to the Mystery of God), thus proved a possible link between Jung and Rahner in the analysis of mystical experience. In developing this work central themes were brought in Jung's work (such as the symbolism of the Self, the conjunction of opposites, the alchemy) and compared with the metaphysical concepts used by Rahner. This combination of thought of both authors proportionate the mystical interpretation from an evolutionary point of view, which implied considerations on the most current areas of scientific psychology, especially neuropsychology. The attempted synthesis of broad fields of knowledge that is this dissertation is something important to the current state of science, admittedly fragmentary and scattered on specific topics. This reason justifies a job in the mold of an exploratory study where they stand in general essential and relevant connections between different theories, connections that make more visible the nature of its objects and its relation to human existence.",,,Portuguese

Escrito para, segundo esclarece seu autor no prefácio, ""habilitar"" os alunos na ""prática da redação"", o livro se trata de uma versão em síntese do conteúdo presente nos manuais de retórica em circulação nas escolas do período. Em busca de entendimento sobre a tradição do ensino retórico com que o livro dialoga, parte-se de observações sobre os tipos de atividades de escrita propostas no Ratio studiorum, método de ensino seguido pela ordem dos jesuítas e que representa algo do que seria o ensino de escrita entre os séculos XVI e XVIII; posteriormente fazem-se considerações sobre a orientação pombalina para o ensino de retórica e de Língua Portuguesa. No capítulo 2, centrando-se então sobre o século XIX, busca-se um panorama da situação em que estariam se organizando o ensino primário e secundário brasileiro, a fim de entender-se o Manual de estylo em sua realidade de existência. A partir daí o trabalho concentra-se na leitura analítica do livro, o que corresponde aos capítulos 3 e 4 da tese, nos quais se discute a presença de uma concepção de linguagem como expressão do pensamento, as repercussões geradas por ela quanto ao tipo de ensino proposto por esse e outros livros didáticos do período e, no âmbito dos gêneros e tipologia textual, a presença da tipologia ?descrição, narração, carta?. Esta tipologia conduz as atividades de escrita do Manual de estylo e de uma série de livros de composição e manuais de português entre os anos finais do século XIX e iniciais do século XX, aspecto sobre o qual traçamos uma série de observações. A constatação do predomínio dessa tipologia para o ensino de produção textual nos leva à hipótese de que a tipologia ""descrição, narração, dissertação"" no universo escolar teria presença somente a partir do século XX, ponto de vista a partir do qual se conclui a análise. A fundamentação teórica da pesquisa tem sua base nos estudos franceses sobre cultura escolar e história das disciplinas escolares desenvolvidos nas últimas décadas por autores como Jean Hébrard, Anne-Marie Chartier e André Chervel. Para o estudo da escola e livro didático brasileiros foram referências centrais trabalhos de Circe Bittencourt, Luciano Mendes de Faria Filho, Antonio Augusto Gomes Batista e Diana Gonçalves Vidal. Sobre o ensino de retórica a leitura se ancora em estudos de Roberto Acízelo de Souza, João Adolfo Hansen, José Maria Paiva e Walter Ong. Sobre gênero e tipologia textual referências centrais vêm de Mikhail Bakhtin, Schneuwly e Dolz, Jean-Michel Adam, Guiomar Ciapuscio e Helena Nagamine Brandão.||This study is a result of a historical research about the teaching of composition in the Brazilian school. The work focuses a school textbook published in Rio de Janeiro in 1883, Manual de estilo, by V. Sá de Menezes. Written to help students in the process of writing, this book is a synthesis of the content presented in Rhetoric textbooks that were used in schools at the end of the 19.th century. Then, in the intention to understand part of the Rhetoric tradition that Manual de Estilo dialogues with, we begin this thesis discussing Ratio studiorum, the Jesuit school's pedagogic method. The goal was to identify different writing types of exercises proposed by the humanistic model of education followed by this religious segment. The choice for the Jesuits came from their importance at the Brazilian educational process during the period from XVI to XVIII century. From the second half of the XVIII century, we selected the orientation of writing education found in Verdadeiro método de estudar, by Luis Antonio Verney, and in Instrucções para os Professores de Grammatica latina Grega, Hebraica, e de Rethorica... announced by the Portuguese government in 1759. In the chapter 2, when we reach the XIX century, we present information about how the elementary e secondary schools were being organized, in order to connect the Manual de estylo to its reality of existence. The analysis of the content of Manual de estylo is developed between the chapter 3 and 4, when we discuss the presence of a conception of language as thinking expression and the repercussions of this understanding to the types of teaching proposed in this book and other textbooks from the end of XIX century and beginning of XX century. The typology ""narration, description and letter"" that we found as the core of the writing process proposed by Manual de estylo and contemporary books suggests us the hypothetical conclusion that the typology ""narration, description, dissertation"" might be an invention created in the XX century, what we discuss in the final chapter. This research is based on the French studies about the scholar culture and the history of the academic disciplines developed in past years by Jean Hébrard, Anne-Marie Chartier, André Chervel and others. For the study of the Brazilian school and Brazilian textbooks we have referred to Circe Bittencourt, Luciano Mendes de Faria Filho, Antonio Augusto Gomes Batista, Diana Gonçalves Vidal and others. About the teaching of Rhetoric we have based our observations on the study of Roberto Azícelo de Souza, João Adolfo Hansen, José Maria Paiva and Walter Ong.",,,Portuguese

E. Malpas, and Michel de Certeau, an individual's experiences inscribe a space (or an undifferentiated area) and make it a place; that place and those experiences contribute to an individual's identity. In applying this theory to early modern English drama, I contend that we can better understand how Elizabethan and Jacobean playwrights responded to the displacement of the English population, as many provincial English moved to London and acquired new physical and social places. Elizabethan playwrights Thomas Kyd and Christopher Marlowe suggest physical place is essential to a character's identity. For later playwrights like William Shakespeare and Ben Jonson, however, physical place is significant but not as central. Instead, as phenomenological theorists posit, place and experiences both contribute to identity.",,,English

C'est pour lui un tournant, car cette nomination apparaît comme une réhabilitation pour un théologien longtemps suspecté d'incliner vers une résurgence du modernisme. Pourtant, il se considère comme un otage dans une commission largement dominée par le Saint-Office, et qui ne porte pas le renouveau qu'il désirait avec ardeur. Quand le concile commence véritablement, il se réjouit alors du tour pris par les événements, qui aboutissent à un large rejet des schémas préparatoires. Henri de Lubac est alors un homme en vue, tant ses travaux théologiques semblent être, avec d'autres, une préparation de l'aggiornamento. Pourtant, par tempérament, par prudence, mais aussi parfois à cause de la maladie, il reste, tout au long du concile, peu intégré à la mécanique conciliaire qui fabrique les textes. Au fur et à mesure des quatre sessions, il balance entre l'espoir du renouveau et les craintes de voir le concile mal compris, surtout en ce qui concerne les questions de relations entre l'Eglise et le monde, notamment en raison d'une crise spirituelle qu'il discerne, tout spécialement en France et dans la Compagnie de Jésus. Reste tout de même l'influence de l'œuvre du Père de Lubac sur l'œuvre conciliaire, difficile à mesurer, parce qu'elle se confond avec celle d'autres théologiens, soucieux comme lui de redonner à la théologie un fondement christologique et un respect du Mystère.||In 1960, the French jesuit Henri de Lubac became consultor to the Preparatory theological commission of the Second Vatican council. It was a turning point for him, because this appointment was understood as a rehabilitation. He was indeed, for a long time, suspected to be a neo-modernist theologian. Though, he thought he was an hostage in a commission which was dominated by the Holy Office to a large extent, and which did not promote the renewal he was waiting for eagerly. When the council began really, he was really satisfied by the events that led to a large rejection of the preparatory texts. Henri de Lubac was then a well-known man because of his books and articles which were like a preparation of the Second Vatican council. Through, because of the illness sometimes, of his character, and of his caution will, he remained, during the whole council, not really inserted in the networks that made the texts. As the council went along, Henri de Lubac was both happy of the aggiornamento, and worried about a possible misunderstanding of the council, especially about the Church and world relation. Indeed, he thought this misunderstanding was made easier by the spiritual crisis which grew up in France, according to him, and especially in the Company of Jesus. However that may be, Henri de Lubac has had an influence on this council by his books and articles, even if it is quite difficult to measure, because it is mixed with the influence of other theologians who wanted, like him, to promote a christological theology, which would have more respect for the Mystery.",Résumés en français et en anglas.,,French

The struggles Carroll faced were the legacy of the English heritage of the colonies. English Catholics who shaped colonial Catholic life made the community private and personal in response to the religious atmosphere in the English world. The American Revolution brought toleration for Catholics and they struggled to adapt their hierarchal religion to new republican language. Some congregations went as far as to deny episcopal power, a theory known as trusteeism. Different interpretations struggled to gain prominence and the issue was not resolved until decades after Carroll’s death in 1815. Yet the Church he left behind provided a strong base for later immigrants who nonetheless dramatically changed the face of the American Catholic Church.",,,English

Arrivé dans la colonie en juin 1667, Pierron, se fit introduire auprès des populations autochtones par Jean Talon, après quoi il eut en charge un territoire d'environ une demi-douzaine de villages agniers de la vallée de l'Hudson. Après avoir livré ses premières impressions, le jésuite mit au point son programme apostolique, faisant appel à une méthode « audio-visuelle » fondée sur le dessin didactique. Mais le jésuite fut aussi un formidable voyageur, qui se rendit non seulement en Iroquoisie, mais aussi en Nouvelle-Angleterre. Il semble bien que ce soit grâce à de précieux réseaux de connaissances en dehors de ceux de la Compagnie de Jésus qu'il put entreprendre un tel voyage. La biographie de ce issionnaire-polyglotte, diplomate et peintre, souligne entre autre choses, l’importance du contexte stratégique et politique plus vaste des missions françaises en Amérique au XVIIe siècle. ||The following study is devoted to the Jesuit father Jean Pierron (1631–1701). Arriving from Lorraine in 1667, Pierron participated in the Catholic mission to the Mohawk of the Hudson Valley, after being formally introduced to delegates of this nation by the intendant Jean Talon. Working in a half-dozen villages, Pierron designed an audiovisual method of conversion based upon didactic drawings and paintings. The missionary was also an energetic traveller, both within Mohawk territories and to the English colonies. These journeys point to Pierron’s earlier experiences and more precisely, to the network of contacts he seems to have developed in Europe. In sum, the life of this polyglot missionary, diplomat and painter underscores the importance of the broader strategic and political context of the Jesuit missions.",,,French
Dissertation,"Fitterer, Robert J.",2004,Bernard Lonergan's Cognitive Theory and Aristotelian Phronesis: Toward a Conception of Performative Objectivity in Virtue Ethics,,University of British Columbia,,PhD diss.,,,http://circle.ubc.ca/handle/2429/15894,,,Philosophy -- Ethics|Philosophy -- Theory of Knowledge,,"Lonergan, Bernard J. F., 1904–1984","Virtue ethics bases moral decision-making, in part, in a skills-like ability to spot morally salient features in the phenomenal world. Aristotle, an exemplar of such ethics, developed a theory of practical wisdom (phronesis) wherein the person of moral expertise makes sound ethical judgments and decisions via direct insight into concrete circumstances. Phronesis involves emotive discernment and agent-relative construal of the world. But emotions and perspectives can also be linked with bias and poor judgment. How are we to think about objectivity if virtue ethics relies upon such apparently subjective factors as emotively influenced dispositions? Bernard Lonergan developed a theory of insight-based human understanding and explores its operation in the concrete circumstances of practical living. His theory offers a process of human learning and knowing that does not avoid emotions and agent-perspectives but seeks to so operate within these factors as to produce a state we could validly call 'being objective.' Agreeing with Aristotle on a key role for emotions, Lonergan goes much further in claiming that some mode of the emotion of love should play a critical role in attaining the insights required for virtue ethics. His treatment of love, however, remains vague. Martha Nussbaum, on the other hand, provides very rich treatment of how love, understood as compassion, can act as a control for perspectival discernment and moral insight. Her theory fills out Lonergan's, allowing us more clearly to see how love (and other emotions) could be conducive to fostering objective viewpoints within morally charged circumstances. Objectivity in virtue ethics can be understood, then, to be what we are more or less attaining to the degree that we self-consciously apprehend and deploy our innate modes of insight-induction and aim these cognitive processes toward a world construed by a background concern of care and compassion.",,,English

Para Suárez el poder político reside originaria y naturalmente en la comunidad, pero ésta puede transferirlo a otro titular. El poder político surge para la realización del bien común y es ésta la finalidad que debe orientar la acción del gobernante; de otro modo es legítima la resistencia. Ahora bien, Suárez desvincula el origen popular del poder del derecho de resistencia: el hecho de que el poder proceda del pueblo no significa que éste pueda recuperarlo ni limitarlo arbitrariamente una vez transferido. Lo que sí retiene el pueblo es el derecho natural a la legítima defensa y, por lo tanto, la resistencia al tirano. La persecución del bien común en las particulares circunstancias del caso concreto determina en Suárez la aceptación de la resistencia, así como las condiciones, límites y fines de ésta. La resistencia a la tiranía supone en Suárez un importante límite fáctico y no institucional al poder político. Es más, en el plano de los hechos, la resistencia civil operaría en el sistema político suareciano a modo de medio de control democrático no institucionalizado del poder político. En un plano más institucional Suárez sostiene que el tirano mal gobernante con justo título puede ser depuesto mediante sentencia emitida por la comunidad, o bien por el papa. Los presupuestos del pensamiento político suareciano, unidos a la finalidad del mismo (búsqueda del bien común efectivo) conforman un enfoque pragmático-fáctico que busca una justicia material que se concreta en la realidad histórica del sujeto social y de la comunidad en que éste se inserta. Como consecuencia, en el sistema político suareciano las respuestas concretas son secundarias. Y, en segundo lugar, la búsqueda del bien común efectivo y real desde la adaptabilidad que le permite su enfoque conduce a Suárez a la aceptación de la resistencia civil. Este enfoque supera la ideologización abstracta moderna. El objeto, propósito, enfoque y, sobre todo, la metodología del presente trabajo de investigación han determinado que se haya seguido el siguiente esquema, que presentamos sumariamente al lector. En el capítulo primero se aborda brevemente la vida y obra de nuestro autor, las realidades contextuales que permiten situar ambas y las diferentes visiones interpretativas desde las que cabe entenderlo. En el capítulo segundo se intenta ofrecer sucintamente un breve relato de los hitos históricos más relevantes de la cuestión de la resistencia antes de Suárez, así como del importante desarrollo que este tema tuvo en los tiempos inmediatamente precedentes a este autor. Adicionalmente, se alude al contexto histórico concreto que mueve a Suárez a escribir de manera más extensa sobre esta materia. En el capítulo tercero se procura esbozar las líneas fundamentales del pensamiento político suareciano que están vinculadas con la resistencia a la tiranía. En el capítulo cuarto se trata la resistencia tal como aparece en la obra de Suárez, comentando diversas cuestiones a modo de glosa aclarativa e interpretativa.

I hypothesize that the Jesuit educational model of the Casa program is a form of peace education that contributes to the formation of agents of positive peace (social justice). To test this hypothesis, I begin by exploring the theoretical links between Chadwick Alger’s model of peace education and the Jesuit educational model of the Casa program. I then explore student perceptions of the impact of the Casa program on their personal development and on their long-term commitment to promoting positive peace by asking two additional questions: (A) How does participation in the Casa de la Solidaridad program influence student understanding of the program’s three key educational goals: (1) education for justice, (2) men and women for others, and (3) global citizenship? (B) How have these three goals (education for justice, men and women for others, and global citizenship), if at all, influenced students’ vocational choices after their completion of the program?|To explore the impact of the program on student development, I used a descriptive case study model. To gain insights into the effects of the Casa experience on students, I conducted 24 interviews primarily using in-depth questionnaires to gather my data. To develop a thick description of the Casa experience, I used both theoretical insights and coding methods.|The findings showed that respondents felt they were profoundly impacted by their experience in the Casa program. In particular, the direct experience in Salvadoran communities through their praxis placement produced a deep sense of solidarity and generated a yearning, and in many cases a feeling of responsibility, to use their vocation as a means of advancing social justice. Based on my findings, I conclude that the Jesuit educational model of the Casa program is contributing to the formation agents of positive peace through a form of peace education.",,,English

In doing so, it seeks to split a gap between Foucault's ideas about nineteenth-century life and Ian Watt's account of the novel genre's rise. It claims that in the first instance, it is easy to feel that distance is compromised, through social surveillance, only disempoweringly; while in the second, it is easy to read aloneness as public triumph as the basis of an ethos of economic independence. It therefore studies texts from the era that admit that being alone cannot be ''pure'' in modern times, yet which show that partialness in solitude can be a boon, helping subjects mediate the plural demands of modernity. Building on the scholarship of Jeff Nunokawa, Christopher Lane, and Amanda Anderson, the current study departs from it by not privileging solitude that implies a rare event, but rather, attends to the mundane. Focusing respectively on women's time, women's space, and economic organization of women's time and space, the first three chapters make a case for reading a trio of prominent texts—Persuasion, Villette, and The Odd Women—through an undernoted support for women's right to withdrawal. As for Dickens's Our Mutual Friend, it shows women gaining ground through co-opting alienation, yet cannot keep from wanting to contain female cleverness as a rule, making it resist and bolster strains of social hypocrisy. Notably, each novel here crafts an ending that rewards strong solitaries with affection. Without erasing solo resilience, they imagine solitaries ''alone together'' in relations that take cues from canny ways of navigating self and world—in other words, that take cues from proactive distance itself. Thus, while the phrase ''the ends of aloneness'' speaks to aims and goals for conduct, another aspect has to do with the forms of closing scenes. Refashioning the marriage plot to acknowledge solo strength, the novels here make social distance anchor new relational forms that combine eccentric views, yet further blend oddities with careful social concessions into patterns of compromise.",,,English

The broadcasting of vernacular culture will be shown to foster intimate and interactive relationships between broadcasters and audiences. Using a theoretical framework that draws upon the work of communications theorists Harold Innis and Walter Ong, the thesis will explore the (secondary) orality of radio broadcasting, and will consider instances in which the normative unidirectional structure and 'passive' orality of radio has been (and can be) made reciprocal and active through the participation of listeners. The inclusion of 'lay voices' and 'vernacular input' in radio broadcasting will be charted as a measure of the democratization of radio, and in order to demonstrate radio's role in disseminating oral history, promoting dialogue, and building and binding communities. The thesis will predominantly focus on local and regional forms of radio: the BBC Regions in the post-war era; regional radio programming serving the Canadianprovince ofNewfoundland both pre- and post-Confederation (which took place in 1949); and the community radio sector in the UK during the last five years. A common theme of many of the case studies within the thesis will be the role of citizen participation in challenging, transgressing or eroding editorial control, institutional protocols and the linguistic hegemony of radio production. Conversely, close attention will be given to the ways in which editorial control in radio production has circumscribed the self-definition of participants and communities. These case studies will provide evidence with which to investigate the following research question - is the democratization of radio possible through the incorporation of citizen voices or messages within radio production or programming, or is it only possible through changing the medium itself through citizen participation in democratic structures of production, management and ownership?.",,,English

The problem of evil, in essence, asks, Why is evil present in the creation of an omnipotent and omnibenevolent God? Chapter 1 defines basic terms, such as 'problem of evil' and 'theodicy,' and frames the debate on evil and theism using recent work in analytic philosophy. I begin with David Hume's attack on 'natural religion' based on the reality of evil. The work of Hume sets the stage for later debates on evil in the analytic philosophy of religion. After Hume, I move to J. L. Mackie's presentation of the atheistic argument from evil, with a focus on Mackie's attack on the free-will defense. I then examine Alvin Plantinga's response to Mackie and Plantinga's endorsement of the free-will defense against Mackie's attack. My discussion of the pivotal Mackie-Plantinga debate on the problem of evil is followed by an examination of three contemporary figures within analytic philosophy who have offered Christian responses to the problem of evil---John Hick, Eleonore Stump, and Marilyn McCord Adams. In the midst of this discussion, I pause to compare the proposals of Plantinga, Hick, Richard Swinburne, and Peter van Inwagen on natural evil. Chapter 2 examines the trinitarian theology of Hans Urs von Balthasar in the context of recent and contemporary trinitarian theology, because I will argue that the doctrine of the Trinity is the essential Christian resource needed to answer the problem of evil. After rehearsing and critiquing the popular story of the rise and fall of trinitarian theology, as told by Karl Rahner, Catherine LaCugna, and others, I examine the tentative place of the Trinity in the doctrinal theology of Friedrich Schleiermacher and Paul Tillich and then the renewed emphasis on the Trinity found in Karl Barth and Rahner. The work of Barth and Rahner provides the framework in which to consider the thought of several major contemporary theologians on the Trinity---Jurgen Moltmann, Walter Kasper, Wolfhart Pannenberg, and John Zizioulas. Once the context has been set, I turn fully to the theology of the Trinity of Hans Urs von Balthasar. I argue that Balthasar's primary account of the immanent Trinity is one of reciprocal, self-giving, interpersonal love dynamically exchanged among distinct divine persons, who share fully and equally in the one divine essence of kenotic love, and that the economic Trinity, particularly in the Cross of Christ, makes trinitarian love present to human persons. In Chapter 3 I develop a theodicy based on Balthasar's theology of the Trinity. I begin by discussing the nature and purpose of theodicy and various recent attacks on the validity of the theological enterprise of theodicy. After clarifying the theological aims of a Christian theodicy, and setting to the side common but inadequate responses to the problem of evil, I turn to my own understanding of a successful Christian theodicy. I begin with Scripture (Genesis, Job, and the Gospels) and then use Pope John Paul II's Salvifici Doloris as a bridge from the Gospel account of the life of Christ to Balthasar's theology of the Trinity and its application to theodicy. I argue that Balthasar's interpersonal model of the Trinity as a life of communal self-giving love and Balthasar's grounding of the economy of salvation in the immanent Trinity provide the proper framework for answering the problem of evil from a Christian theological perspective. I conclude that human suffering, united to the Cross of Christ, becomes a participation in the life of the Triune God in a way that renders such suffering of great salvific value to the one who suffers and that thus justifies God's permission of innocent suffering. Finally, as a connection between Balthasar's work and American popular culture, I observe the trinitarian features of the response to the problem of evil found in William P. Young's recent best-selling novel The Shack and discover claims concerning the Trinity and theodicy that resonate deeply with the theology of Balthasar. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)",,,English

The majority of the dissertation's work consists in uncoupling Rahner's difficult term, Vorgriff, from the metaphorical associations of grasping (greifen) latent within it.

Les missions des Jésuites en Chine depuis la fin du XVIIe siècle assurent la continuation de la présentation de cet art de manière plus précise et concrète durant tout un siècle. On peut distinguer trois périodes chronologiques: la première période est représentée par le rejet, l'incompréhension ou de simples croquis de l'architecture chinoise. Les représentants en sont le Père Louis Le Comte et des autres premiers Jésuites en Chine; la deuxième période montre une certaine acceptation de l'art chinois. Les présentions des Jésuites, bien que neutres, ouvrent la voie en Europe à une vague orientaliste. Le Frère Attiret est le représentant de cette période. Dès la publication de sa lettre en 1749, l'Europe pose son regard sur le jardin chinois, particulièrement à travers Yuan ming yuan. Cette lettre contribue alors à la création des parcs ""imités de la Chine"" à travers toute l'Europe; la troisième période est caractérisée par les ouvrages des jésuites dont le séjour en Chine s'étend à la deuxième moitié du XVIIIe siècle, surtout de ceux qui ont réalisé les ""Mémoires concernant des Chinois"". Le Père Cibot est l'auteur le plus brillant, il tente d’élaborer une théorie du jardin chinois. Il traduit un poème de Sima Guang qui montre la façon dont les Chinois lettrés conçoivent leur jardin et publie un essai sur le jardin chinois qui a permis aux Européens d'approfondir leurs connaissances.||18th century Europe already knew about Chinese architecture through the drawings shown on the manufactured goods that had been sent in for long. Since the end of the 17th century, the detailed reports from the Jesuits living in China allowed the introduction of Chinese art into Europe, in a more complete and precise way. We can divide this introduction into three chronological periods: The first one is a period of reject, of misunderstanding due to the superficiality of the sketches about Chinese architecture, represented by Father Louis Le Comte and other first Jesuits in China. The second period shows, to certain extend a better acceptation of Chinese architecture. The presentations done by the Jesuits, although neutral, open the way to an orientalistic wave in Europe. Father Attiret is representative of this period. As soon as his letter is published, in 1747, Europe's interest grows on Chinese gardens, particularly Yuan Ming Yuan. His letter contributes then to the creation of parks and gardens ""in the Chinese way"" all over Europe. The third period is characterized by the works of Jesuits who stayed in China as long as the second part of the 18th century, mainly those who contributed to the ""Mémoires concernant des chinois"". Father Cibot is the most brilliant author about architecture, with his theory on the Chinese garden. His translation of a poem by Sima Guang shows the manner used by lettered Chinese people to create their own gardens, while deepens the European people's approach to the subject.",,,French

Macleod's Alexander MacDonald and Laurence's Morag Gunn seek an historical context in which to locate themselves, and their ancestral stories help to form the underpinnings of their individual identities, but also challenge each protagonist to re-mediate these experiences through the lens of the more advanced modes of communication that are available in the late twentieth century. The transition from orality to literacy and beyond also has a profound effect on the protagonists' conceptualization of home and nation. The work of a number of media theorists, including Benedict Anderson, Roland Barthes, Walter Benjamin, Stanley Cavell, Ronald Deibert, and Walter Ong, provide the basis for an analytical framework in which to locate these works. David Williams' criticism of media influences in a number of Canadian works opens a space for the discussion of how these theorists address the ontological complexities of the interweaving of media and narrative. This reading of the two novels contends that, although Diviners (1974) is earlier than Mischief (1999) in terms of publication, it is actually Laurence's novel that takes the more postmodern approach in its hybridity of form, as well as its social content. while Alexander, wittingly or not, is implicated in ""museumizing"" his oral Gaelic culture by committing it to print, Morag moves through oral tales to photography and into a far more fluid ""past-present"" that is well served by her innovative ""Memorybank Movies."" Moreover, the multimedia techniques that characterize Morag's narrative anticipate hypertext and create an epistemology of a plural, hybrid nation that leaves a living legacy for Morag's Metis daughter Pique and affirms a plural, overlapping collage of identities that is truly representative of Canada's multicultural nature.",,,English

English Catholics faced legal sanctions, social isolation, and physical harm for practicing their faith, and the Catholic church began a campaign to maintain, educate, and minister to the community covertly through the use of Jesuit missionaries and published pedagogical texts. The influence of such experiences can be seen in the literary works of John Donne, Robert Southwell, Richard Crashaw, and Elizabeth Cary, as well as in the instructional works by lesser-known Catholic writers including John Fowler, Thomas Wright, John Bucke, Henry Garnet, Gaspar Loarte, John Mush, Jeanne de Cambray, and Agnes More. These texts also show a stylistic influence upon one another wherein pedagogical texts utilize poetic language, and poetic texts instruct the reader in religious practice through modeling and example. Through a careful reading of these works, I examine the early modern literary landscape of England in its Catholic context. Finally, I argue that the question of Protestant/Catholic identity led to the development of a religious poetics that emphasized the role of the individual within this crisis and, more importantly, in his or her relationship with God.",,,English

Marcelino García, S.J. has been the president of Belen Jesuit Preparatory School for 25 years. The longevity and success of his tenure is an exemplary case of effective leadership and provided significant insight into what constitutes effective school leadership. The target population for this case study consisted of the school’s 7 administrators, 90 faculty members, 10 English-speaking staff members, and 3 key informants. Data were collected using Bolman and Deal’s (1997) Leadership Orientation Survey along with the Jesuit Secondary Education Administration’s (1994) Administrative Leadership Profile Survey (ALPS). Data collected from the surveys were analyzed using the SPSS, version 10. The study also included data collected from focus interviews with Fr. García and six other significant members of the school community. The interviews were approximately 1–hour individual interviews that employed a semi-structured guide. A concurrent triangulation method was used that directly compared the results from these data collection methods. This was done by looking at the data as a whole and in parts. The parts were internal (faculty, administrators, and staff) and external (parents, alumni, and the superior of the Jesuit community) sectors. The comparison of the findings was then examined in terms of each research question. Analysis of the data revealed that while Fr. García’s predominant leadership style reflected the typical Bolman and Deal characteristics associated with the political frame, his leadership demonstrates access to all four frames. Research has found a correlation between multiple frame use and successful leadership. Relatedly, Fr. García’s capacity to approach his administration from various perspectives is indicative of success. In addition, from the perspective of Jesuit education, an analysis of Fr. García’s leadership indicated recurring themes that contributed to the school’s organizational health. The results of this study provide an extensive analysis of the administration of a unique leader. An analysis of Fr. García’s leadership style from two perspectives gives fresh insight into sustained and successful leadership.",,,English

One way to confront the dangers of loosing old privileges is through the redefinition and revival of old codes of conduct and behavior that in the past set them apart from the rest. In the process, old heroes considered instrumental in establishing and shaping their power are retrieved and glorified, and their heroic deeds offered as examples to emulate in the present. During the XVII Century, and in analogous circumstances, the Spanish Baroque writer Baltasar Gracián observes with trepidation the rapid changes in his own society, the breaking down of the social and political order of Imperial Spain. To protect his interests as member of the hegemonic group: —male, Catholic, noble and scholar—, he looks back in history and constructs heroic paradigms utilizing old heroes whose values embody his own. Since the heroic figures incarnate the ideals of the elite, there are neither heroes nor heroism outside the hegemonic class. This dissertation studies three texts by Baltasar Gracián (1601–1658): El Héroe (1637), El Discreto (1646), and El Criticón (Part I, 1651, Part II, 1653, Part III, 1657), that are centered on the heroic male, analyzing changes in the consecutive male heroic prototypes in light of the author's social and historical experience. Gracián's evolving heroic models respond to transformations in the hegemonic position of the Spanish state, moving from profuse optimism and idealism in his first text to disillusion and abandonment in the last one. The Jesuit's work is a crucible in which he tests Occidental values and heroics over his lifetime, adapting each heroic prescription to satisfy the political, historical, social and religious necessities of his present. Although Gracián's heroic formula changes over time, the connecting thread remains: the blood nobility of Castile/Aragón will save the hegemony of the nation. This elitism verbalizes a reactionary anachronism that negates the heroic essence, which is to act in the world on behalf of others. Gracián's texts are progressive, specular images of the author and his society. In all cases, the heroic figure functions as metonym of the Empire in which the strength of the hero confirms the power of the State.",,,Spanish

L’analyse du corpus de l’artiste suggère que ce dernier participe à la diffusion de récits mythologiques propres à l’Amérique : à cet effet, la comparaison des œuvres de Légaré aux séries de tableaux du peintre états-unien Thomas Cole (1801–1848) souligne la présence d’une structure cyclique similaire, inspirée des mythologies européennes, mais dans laquelle sont réactualisées de nouvelles données (territoriales, socioculturelles, politiques) proposées par le continent américain. Ainsi, la production de Légaré s’ordonne en fonction d’un archémythe principal, celui de la régénérescence de la nation, et de mythes fondateurs qui retracent les débuts de l’histoire coloniale, alors que se côtoyaient l’Amérindien et le missionnaire jésuite. Tandis que le premier, par association symbolique, devient une figure de rhétorique prédominante dans le discours identitaire tenu par l’artiste, le second y est plutôt célébré pour sa résistance à l’Autre et son courage. À ce chapitre, cette étude démontre l’existence d’une filiation effectuée par l’artiste entre les Canadiens français, les communautés autochtones et les martyrs jésuites, laquelle repose sur le destin tragique qui leur est respectivement associé et le statut de victime qu’ils endossent. Ainsi, la mythologie nationale véhiculée dans les œuvres de Légaré s’articule autour de mythes dépresseurs, axés sur l’idée d’une nation vaincue, mais qui, par la prise en charge de sa mémoire collective, pourra un jour renaître de ses cendres.| |The purpose of this study is to integrate the historical paintings of French Canadian painter Joseph Légaré (1795–1855) into an American tradition of pictorial representation. The analysis of the artist’s corpus suggests that he participates in the diffusion of American mythological narratives. Indeed, the comparison between the paintings of Légaré and those of the American painter Thomas Cole (1801–1848) underlines the presence of a similar cyclic structure, inspired by European myths, but in which are updated new territorial, cultural and political data specific to the American continent. From this perspective, the artistic production of Légaré organizes itself according to a main “archémythe”, one of national renewal, and some founding myths, which redraw the beginnings of colonial history, where the Amerindian and the Jesuit missionary predominated. The Indian, by symbolic association, becomes a rhetorical figure in the discourse of national identity formulated by the artist, whereas the Jesuit martyr is rather celebrated for his resistance and his courage in front of the other. In this regard, this study demonstrates the existence of an association made by the painter between French Canadians, Native people and Jesuit martyrs, which is based on the tragic fate that is associated with each group and the status of victim that they had to assume. Consequently, the national mythology represented in the works of Légaré is structured around depressant myths, based on the idea of a defeated nation, but which, by the creation of a collective memory, can, one day, rise from the ashes.",,,French

Operative among these contemporary theologians' assumptions, though, is the notion that classical theism is ""perfect being theology"" and vice versa thereby conflating perfect being theology with aspects of the Christian tradition. Implicit within perfect being theology is a scientific methodology that reduces reality to only empirically verifiable facts.|But perhaps these theologians are ignoring important resources for resolving the dilemma--namely God's beauty. How might the peculiar beauty of the cross, then, understood in terms of God's theodrama--the economic Trinity as summary of the Gospel-- rather than as a perfect being address some of the concerns of relational theism? By critically appropriating Hans Urs von Balthasar's focus on Jesus Christ as the distinct speaking and doing form ( Gestalt ) of God's beauty, a form of divine communicative action, it is my contention that God's beauty is the fittingness seen in the incarnate Son's actions to the Father's will that radiates God's glory and enraptures properly perceiving subjects, transforming the imagination through the shaping power of the Spirit and drawing them to participate in God's drama of redemption.|I establish this thesis by conceptually expanding upon a relevant biblical motif found in the theological patterning of the Suffering Servant in Jeremiah and its connection with wisdom, linking it with a theological interpretation of Col 1–2:5. In doing so, God's actions in Christ's redemptive-creative suffering and glorious resurrection become necessary to defining God's beauty as the perfect attunement or fittingness of the incarnate Son's actions in the Spirit to the Father's will. Consequently, God's beauty requires action, imploring believers to imaginatively participate in God's theodrama. In resurrecting the imagination, I suggest that the imagination is transformed by participating in the beauty of God's trinitarian life revealed by the Spirit in incarnate Beauty (2 Cor 3:18). As such, we manifest fitting performances in the dramatic theater of God's glory.",,,English

Son objectif est de réviser la conception actuelle de l'historiographie du cinéma en France de 1896 jusqu'au début des années 1950 en remettant en question la vision homogène du courant historique de l'histoire traditionnelle du cinéma telle que l'ont présentée les tenants de la nouvelle histoire du cinéma. Cette thèse se divise en trois parties. J'expose dans la première mon cadre et mon principal outil d'analyse. Je présente l'opération historiographique telle que définie par Michel de Certeau, soit comme le croisement dun lieu social marqué par des cadres intellectuels dominants, dun ensemble de procédures dont l'historien se sert pour sélectionner ses sources et construire les faits, et enfin, dune écriture qui implique l'élaboration dun système de relations entre les différents faits construits.

Its goal is to revise the present-day conception of film historiography in France from 1896 to the early 1950s by calling into question the view of traditional film history as homogeneous portrayed by the new film historians. This thesis is divided into three sections. In the first, I describe my tools and analytical framework. I discuss the historiographical operation as it defined by Michel de Certeau, as the three-way encounter of a social space marked by dominant intellectual frameworks, a range of procedures used by historians to select their sources and construct events, and, finally, the writing of history, which involves creating a system of relations between the various events so constructed. I then describe historical currents in France from the 1870s to the early 1950s. This survey enables me to better identify the exchanges, borrowings and enrichments that occurred during this period between history and film history. In the second part, I “construct” from within a vast range of discourses – those of film historians, cultural historians and film theorists – the dominant conception of film historiography. I show that it is created by product of those who are known by many commentators as the new film historians and that it is reduced as the succession of two great historical currents: traditional film history and new film history. I then discuss how this periodisation has been instrumentalised by those who created it. The goal of the new historians is not to bring to light the plurality of writings on film history, but rather to show the break that they have brought about in film historiography. Finally, a discussion of the role accorded to the mode of film exhibition known as Hale’s Tours in general film histories published before and after the Brighton Congress enables me to soften the break between these two historical currents. In the third part, I examine several ways of approaching film history. I identify various breaks in film historiography in France with respect to the historical topic historians adopt, the conceptual tools they call upon and the relations between these historians and the sources they employ. These case studies, finally, enable me to document the wealth of film historiography in France before the early 1950s.",,,French

It includes a brief analysis of how high school faculty and administrators can work collaboratively with parents in fostering the moral formation of youth. This study is significant and unique in four ways. First, no other research study offers a fully-developed character education approach and framework for Christian, Catholic religious education. Second, this study highlights what is often left out of the field of Religious Educationnamely the moral formation of our students. Third, the contemporary character education movement focuses primarily on public elementary and middle school education. This study looks at character formation as it occurs in secondary schooling. Most significantly, this study brings the best elements of character education to Jesuit pedagogy, and outlines an approach for cultivating character in Jesuit high schools as part of a comprehensive approach to Catholic religious education. This study is a humanistic, and in particular a Christian humanistic, and historical study that is informed by contemporary scholarship in history, theology, ethics, education and religious education. It provides an overview of the relevant literature on character and character education, with interpretation, analysis, and a critique from a religious educational perspective. The study also provides an overview of the history of character education in Christian religious education. It demonstrates that while academic excellence is an important goal for Jesuit secondary schools, greater attention can and should be focused, in accord with the principles of Jesuit education, on the development of character in order to produce well-rounded persons.",,,English

His early religious poetry utilized nature-based metaphors to express his love of Christ and trace the immanence of God within nature. He borrowed heavily from the aesthetics of Pater and the philosophy of Duns Scotus. The dissertation explores these early influences and assesses their contribution to the formation of a unique religious interpretation of life and the formulation of an aesthetic congruent with this religion. The dissertation dissects early symptoms of religious doubt within his poetry and finally analyses his ""Terrible Sonnet"" phase in detail to ascertain whether the crisis so often described as occurring during this period was religious or merely reflected a loss of creative ability.",,,English

Specifically, I argue that the Catholic sacramental imagination holds the potential to enact a public counter-narrative to the legal, rhetorical, and ideological structures that both legitimize and conceal the reality of institutionalized torture. I approach this task by examining the roots of the Catholic moral imagination in the sacramental traditions of the church's faith regarding the life, suffering, death, and resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth, and by arguing that this tradition necessarily implies certain ethical and theological claims (articulated in Catholic social teaching) regarding the inviolable dignity of the human person. Central to my study is the conviction that a theological response to torture is effective only insofar as it confronts, resists, and de-legitimizes the idolatrous pretensions of American empire. My point of departure lies primarily in the resources and warrants of my own faith tradition, notably a post-Vatican II sacramental theology. The basis of my argument lies in the claim that Catholic sacramentality is intrinsically ethical because it is rooted in the Paschal Mystery, which is historically and irrevocably linked to the commitment to justice for all who have suffered and died at the hand of empire. At the same time, I argue that this tradition, and the moral imagination it generates, contribute valuable resources to the task of forging a broader public consensus against torture and indefinite detention as legal responses to the global war on terror."" I approach the notion of a ""Catholic moral imagination"" as a response to torture in terms of an ideal yet to be fully realized. At the same time, I draw upon existing cultural and symbolic structures within the tradition which I argue are capable of eliciting moral outrage and effective political resistance to torture. These resources include a broadly sacramental and communal worldview, an estimable body of social thought whose cornerstone is the inviolable dignity of the human person, and a rich historical tradition of prophetic social engagement. The dissertation does not attempt a comprehensive sacramental or liturgical theology. Instead, it considers, in some depth, the sacramental dimensions of a broader alternative social imagination, one which seeks to counter our national amnesia around U.S. involvement in torture, to resist official narratives regarding the necessity and moral justification of torture, and to foster a different way of ""imagining"" our perceived enemies.""--Abstract, leaves i-ii.",,,English

The purpose of the dissertation is to describe the doctrines of the knowledge of God and the Trinity as articulated by Gregory of Nazianzus, the Eastern father who defined these doctrines for the Eastern tradition, for the purpose of critically evaluating the contemporary models that seek to find their historical precedent in the Cappadocians.|The first two chapters demonstrate Gregory's doctrines of the knowledge of God and the Trinity in order to demonstrate how his numerous confessions all relate to and modify one another. Gregory's doctrine of God was based upon God's nature being infinite and only known through his actions and names. Gregory's doctrine of the Trinity is multifaceted so that he uses a number of grammars to defend the unity and the three persons. Chapter four compares Augustine's On The Trinity to Gregory's grammars to provide a concrete comparison between the two traditions to demonstrate that the typical paradigm that contrasts the East and West is oversimplified and wrong.|The contemporary models will then be analyzed in light of Gregory's grammars and model in order to demonstrate that they have introduced concepts and grammars that are contrary to that of Gregory. The contemporary theologians analyzed include Karl Rahner, Cornelius Plantinga, Bruce Ware, and Thom McCall. The contemporary models are wrong to claim Gregory as their historical precedent because they fail to meet the most basic standards of Orthodoxy as presented by Gregory. One of the main problems in the contemporary treatment of Gregory is that his doctrine is oversimplified so that one aspect or grammar is emphasized and the others are ignored. There is confusion over the proper relationship between the economic and immanent Trinities. There is also a number of problems in how the terms one, unity, essence, and person have been redefined by the contemporary models when compared to Gregory's doctrine. The final argument is that the contemporary models fail to provide the necessary grammars and confessions that safeguard the doctrine of the Trinity and promote worship when compared to Gregory.",,,English

The painting is punctuated by numerous city markers, with the largest indicating the city of Rome. On the other screen, twenty-eight cities of the world and Christian and Muslim kings in ceremonial attire on horseback are depicted. This pair of screens was probably produced in the early seventeenth century. It was most likely painted by Jesuit-trained Japanese painters who had learned western themes and painting techniques: perspective and chiaroscuro. Until the sixteenth century, Japanese experience with and knowledge of the world was limited to its neighbouring lands, such as China, Korea, and India. Beyond the realm of Japan lay worlds formed through fascination and the imagination. In 1543, however, this changed with the appearance of the Portuguese, who journeyed to Japan in the pursuit of new lands to develop trade and to spread Christianity. The Portuguese and their culture had a strong impact on Japanese thoughts and activities, including the creation of many screens with European motifs and new views of the world at large. This pair of screens was drawn upon Dutch prototype made by Petrus Kaerius (1571–1646) in 1609. In my thesis I will examine how ""World-Map-and-Twenty-Eight-City"" screens performed a two-fold function. I will first examine how the screens marked Jesuit propagation of Christianity in Japan, and second I will examine how the screens articulated what might be called an emergent sense of Japanese collective identity. By this I do not mean identity based on nationalism, which emerged in Japan only in the nineteenth century. Rather, I mean an increasing awareness of the Self in relation to Other, and not only in relation to those outside the geographic confines of Japan but also within. What I intend to explore is how definitions of geography and culture in world map screens, and specifically ""World-Map-and-Twenty-Eight-City"" screens, prompted viewers to acknowledge a more distinctive Self. The end of the sixteenth and the beginning of the seventeenth centuries was a transitional moment for both the Jesuits and Portugal. Religiously, the Jesuits were in conflict with the Japanese government and, as well their authority was undermined by Mendicants from the Philippines. These conflicts were compounded further by the spread of Protestantism in Europe. Similarly, after a short prosperous trade in Asia, rising economic and political power of the Netherlands and England gradually pushed Portuguese trade out of Asia. By comparing ""World-Map-and-Twenty-Eight-City"" screens with ""In-and-Around- Kyoto"" screens, I argued that the Jesuit's hidden agenda of glorifying Christendom and God's order on earth emerged. Moreover, by comparing this pair with ""Four-Continent-and- Forty-Eight-People"" screens, I detect the emergence of sense of a Japanese Self, that was forged in relation to the Europeans. Although the screens give the impression of the orderly and peaceful world, they mask the unstable situation which the Jesuits and Portugal were experiencing at the time. In the end, I propose that ""World-Map-and-Twenty-Eight-City"" screens transformed and reworked the Dutch prototype from a geographical mode to one that is highly decorative. Rather than articulating a Japanese view of the world, the screens maintained the notion of a powerful Catholic world.",,,English

The thesis is a narrative, with comentary on the political events of the reign of James VI, including the relationship Huntly had with James VI and the wider repercussions thereof. Huntly returned to Scotland from France in July 1581, becoming a courtier and an adherent of Esme Stewart, duke of Lennox. He served a political apprenticeship to Lennox and was exposed to covert Catholic politicking, as well as to the nascent Jesuit mission in Scotland. After James was captured by the Ruthven Raiders in August 1582, Huntly entered politics in his own right, becoming influential in the opposition to the rithven regime. Huntly assisted in enforcing the regime change when James escaped from the Ruthven lords in June 1583, his loyalty to the king winning James's trust and close friendship - the dividends of which he reaped throughout his life. Huntly initially supported the new administration under James Stewart, earl of Arran and assiduously attended to his duties in both the locality and the central government. Following Arran's fall in November 1585, Huntly deliberately distanced himself from the Court and the new Anglophile government. He opposed the anglo-Scottish treaty which was concluded in July 1586 and worked hard to counter the rise of John Maitland of Thirlestane. For the first time, Huntly made contact with the European counter-Reformation in Apriland May 1586. The period June 1587 to April 1589 was marked by faction fighting between Huntly and Maitland, who were both instrumental in James' pursuit of diametrically opposed policies. The discovery of Huntly's covert correspondece with Spain in February 1589 made his Catholic politicking public, subsequently colouring the conflict vetween Maitland and Huntly with confessional politics. Events excalated until Huntly mustered troops on the field of Brig o' Dee near Aberdeen, Although Huntly refused to meet the king on the field, Maitland's vitory was only parial. Brig o' Dee was not the manifestation of the politics of the Counter-Reformation in Scotland, but the productof years of faction fighting between Maitland and Huntly. The period of January 1590 to March 1595 was characterised by Hunrly's continuing influence at Court with marked favour from James and his bloodfeud with James Stewart, second earl of Moray. Huntly used his twin centres of influnce, the Court and power in the region, to fight a vivious and protacted bloodfeud with Moray and his faction. The interception of the Spanish Blanks at the end of 1592 brought confessional politics to bear on a purely secular bloodfeud. Political agitation from the Kirk and Stewarts caused James to commission an army under Archibald Campbell, seventh earl of Argyll to pursue Huntly in October 1594. The result was the battle of Glenlivet between Huntly and Argyll which came to represent the fight against Catholicism, although its root cause was Huntly's bloodfeud with Moray and the Stewarts. When James later raised his own army and marched north against Huntly, the early refused to face James on the field and in March 1595 he voluntarily went into exile abroad. This ended the most active phase of huntly's participation in national and international politics; after his political rehabilitation in 1597, he no longer played an influential role in the king's domestic or foreign policies. Overall, the thesis agues that Huntly needs to be understood as a political faction leader, whose Catholicism was a tool he eomplyed to widen his political influence but not the determinant of all his actions.",,,English

I focus upon plays that reinterpret the Biblical Parable of the Prodigal Son to argue that the Society of Jesus utilized the stage to acquire religious authority over the domestic sphere and to promote paradigms of masculinity that would halt imperial decline. Chapter One sets forth a theoretical framework for this discussion by employing performance theory to establish that theatrical productions often dialogue with the social issues of their day. It reviews the historical context of Jesuit theater to assert that these plays emphasized the benefits of sincere religious devotion, a goal important to the Society and to Tridentine Catholicism. The second chapter examines the prodigal figure's journey in Pedro Pablo de Acevedo's Comedia Caropo (Seville, 1565) and Comedia Filauto (Seville, 1565), Juan de Cigorondo's Tragedia intitulada Oçio (Puebla, 1586), and Pedro de Salas's Coloquio de la Escolástica triunfante y la nueva Babilonia (Soria, 1611). These plays characterize this journey as a spatialized rejection of virtuous paternal authority, after which the prodigals are adrift in a morally contested social sphere. The representation of public space as morally dangerous communicates a need for youth to obey pious elders. Onstage, this includes obedience to a counselor figure who mediates the son's return home. In Chapter Three, I argue that the counselor's performed moral superiority works to legitimate the Society's religious authority over the domestic sphere. Chapters Three and Four then explore the corrective advice offered by counselor figures as they mediate the prodigals' repentance. I conclude that Acevedo's plays encourage noble youth to steward their patrimonies well by guarding them from lower-class parasites. Cigorondo's work addresses the historical concern for idle Creole youth by depicting diligent study and economic productivity as requisites of male virtue in colonial New Spain. In Castile, Salas's work critiques the decadence associated with Philip III's court and posits membership in the Society of Jesus as a fulfilling alternative for youth seeking to realize a virtuous masculinity. By interrogating the construction of religious virtue in these distinct texts, I ascertained that this group of plays reworks the Parable of the Prodigal Son in order to address the immediate concerns of the Society of Jesus. Through the counselor figure these works strive to acquire clerical authority over the domestic sphere, and through the corrective advice offered to prodigal figures these plays seek to shape male behavior in a way that will advance the interests of both Church and Empire.",,,English

As missionaries and prolific authors, the Jesuits were crucial to the expansion and representation of the frontiers of New Spain; likewise, the Spanish-American mission frontier was essential to Jesuit subjectivity as a space of meaningful action where the missionary could perform the ideal of ascetic conduct preserved in Christian tradition. Through the performance of this ideal and the production of missionary narratives and natural histories, the Jesuits bridged the ascetic ideal and the inner-worldly exercise of self-discipline and social control that is central to theories of modernity. The idealized representation of the Jesuit subject's conduct not only reaffirmed the order's corporate identity but also actualized a political and cultural hegemony through narratives that served as a medium for establishing value orientations in all strata of Novohispanic society. Originating in the Society's tradition of ""Edifying Letters,"" eighteenth-century Jesuit narratives increasingly turned towards more detailed accounts of individual subjects' lives and reiterated a common narrative structure covering their early childhood, education within the order, work as teachers and finally the fulfillment of their apostolic vocation on the frontier. This phenomenon is observable in the boom of Jesuit-authored missionary hagiographies appearing in New Spain from 1725 until the expulsion of the order in 1767, coinciding with the Society's most embattled period in both New Spain and Europe. The proliferation of works representing individual missionaries' ""vidas y virtudes"" was accompanied by the differentiation of missionary biography from Jesuit-authored natural histories, which increasingly focused on a secular European reading public. Nevertheless, both genres reflect the enactment of the Jesuit ascetic ideal in distinct value spheres of colonial and European modernity: while the biography of the exemplary missionary responded to the imperatives of social control and the ethical rationalization of the colonial order, Jesuit natural history presupposed an ascetic subject that increasingly pursued knowledge of the natural world as an end in itself.",,,English

Jesuit missionaries did not intend to preserve any ""Gentile"" elements believed to be idolatrous, evil, or the product of the devil.

F., 1904–1984","This study examines how Bernard Lonergan's philosophy of education can provide a fuller understanding of the role of critical thinking in teaching religion in Catholic high schools. It offers a philosophical rationale for the incorporation of critical thinking into the Catholic high school religion classroom and it suggests a pedagogical model for that incorporation, using Lonergan's educational model of theological studies found in Method in Theology. The study employs a philosophical methodology to demonstrate the need for developing adolescents' critical thinking capacities in the context of teaching religion in order to help them grow as authentic knowing and valuing subjects. It not only highlights the importance of promoting adolescents' religious literacy in the texts, creeds, practices, and symbols of the Catholic sacred tradition; but also, it emphasizes the need to cultivate students' religious articulacy, which allows them to give more critically nuanced, articulate form to their own religious questions, understandings, values, and beliefs. The study argues that cultivating such articulacy is best done through dialectical and dialogic discourse in the religion classroom, inviting students to become active participants in the ongoing conversation of the Catholic intellectual tradition. The study shows how Lonergan's eightfold division of the functional specialties of theology into two dynamic movements, downward as the ""mediated"" phase of theology and upward as the ""mediating"" phase of theology, can be used to create such dialectical conversations in the religion classroom in order to foster students' authentic knowing and valuing. Finally, the study offers an analysis and a critique of the USCCB's current Curriculum Framework for teaching religion in Catholic high schools, using the essential elements of a curriculum that would promote religious literacy and articulacy, based on the study's findings. It recommends a redesign of the Curriculum Framework.",,,English

Prior to the 1630s, members of the community struggled with persecution or, if fortunate, benign neglect. The 1630s, however, marked a noticeable shift in how this community was treated by the Stuart court. A group of English Catholics responded to the changing atmosphere, hoping for toleration and even reunion. These individuals, including Franciscus ‡ Sancta Clara, Thomas White, Henry Holden, Serenus Cressy, and John Austin, attempted to re-create an English Catholic identity. English Catholics had long been stigmatized because of the radicalism of the Jesuits, particularly in the Protestant imagination. Jesuits were considered to be ultramontanists, uncompromising doctrinaires, and fifth columnists who were constantly working to undermine the state. In constructing an identity that was rooted in the rhetoric of moderation, moderate Catholics contended that these Protestant concerns were stylized and misperceived. They attempted to resolve the inconsistencies associated with their two seemingly incompatible identities, English and Catholic, suggesting that this conciliation now warranted toleration. They thus attempted to ""un-Jesuit"" the Catholic image by establishing a religious and political common ground with the Protestant majority. To do so, they proclaimed allegiance at first to the monarchy and later to the commonwealth, appeared willing to modify Catholic teachings, and attempted to weaken their ties with the papacy, always prioritizing the common good; they essentially portrayed themselves firstly as good English subjects and secondly as Catholics. Often opportunistic and occasionally adopting dubious theological stances, they capitalized on shifting political moments to secure their lives and properties, to live free of religious persecution, and to acquire power and liberty over their consciences.",,,English

Lonergan's methodological framework, which he called functional specialization, provides a generic differentiation of tasks, each of which is central to the overall project of understanding religious diversity. This thesis explores the relevance and utility of functional specialization as a methodological approach to religious diversity in the philosophy of religion. The first chapter is an analysis of the literature on religious diversity as a topic in the philosophy of religion. It unearths the dominant concerns in the field and some of the obstacles which continue to hinder the development of this enquiry. The second chapter provides the epistemological grounds of functional specialization. While the division of tasks outlined by Lonergan's methodology is useful simply insofar as it differentiates the tasks of academic enquiry, there are more theoretical grounds by which this division is justified. The third chapter provides an explanatory account of the operations and tasks involved in each of the eight functional specialties. It elucidates these specialties by drawing upon relevant analogies from outside the field of religious studies. The fourth chapter brings together the two main concerns of the study by suggesting ways in which functional specialization can make a methodological contribution to the enquiry into religious diversity. It organizes the distinct but related tasks which constitute the philosophical study of religious diversity, demonstrates the current trends regarding each of these tasks, and suggests ways in which they can be made more effective. Lonergan's notion of functional specialization makes an important contribution to the philosophical debate over religious diversity in significant ways. It provides an effective methodology which delineates both the fundamental tasks of scholarly enquiry and the operations involved in these tasks. It explains how current work in the philosophy of religious diversity could benefit from a clear delineation of the relevant tasks. It provides a framework which is open to collaboration among scholars of diverse philosophical and theological viewpoints.",,,English

This surge on growth of the city poses questions about the quality of its future public and private spaces and its patterns of growth. In the face of these questions the thesis briefly navigates the political and economic landscape of Toronto and its most common practices of city making in search for alternatives. It proposes a new type of urbanism that is driven by ordinary people. This urbanism allows for building a city that is more reflective of the multitude and complex sum of the urban population of Toronto and is more compatible with the rapid cycles of economy, new paradigms in culture and the unforeseen conditions of growth. Tactical Urbanism, as a response to aforementioned conditions, uses tactics to influence the long term planning, rearrange power in the field of action and make use of limited resources. According to Michel de Certeau, tactic is the ruse of players in a field that is dominated by others. In this case the field is the city, the objective is building public and shared spaces and the City and developers are the dominant players. In this thesis four separate projects, that were developed and undertaken between June 2012 and October 2013 in Toronto by the author and in collaboration, are presented as experiments for examining the effectiveness, techniques and possibilities within Tactical Urbanism. Developed mostly based on the concept of détournement (diversion), borrowed from the Situationist International, two streams of experiment are developed: one that is defined by temporary appropriation of space and the other by narrating the city through dynamic and ludic space of walking. Both of these streams of action are concerned with the personal relationship of people and places and focus on fostering a sense of belonging and ownership over the urban built environment.",,,English

F., 1904–1984","According to Bernard Lonergan being is connatural with intelligibility; the universe is ultimately systematic and intelligible right down to the smallest detail. But what does this mean for freedom, and what does this mean for moral responsibility? In this thesis we will examine the grounds of moral responsibility in Lonergan's early works on Thomas Aquinas' theory of operative grace. This issue is of fundamental importance to ethics, as it will determine the nature of our ability to act morally, and our limitations. Therefore through this thesis we will see that Lonergan's early works on operative grace are also of fundamental importance to ethics. We will begin with the Pelagian controversy, where the question first emerged. Then we will examine Lonergan's philosophical and methodological assumptions as he began his ""apprenticeship"" to Aquinas. And finally, we will examine the actual content of Lonergan's presentation. What will become evident is that this is a complex question; in fact, it pushes human reason to its limits. Ultimately, it may only be able to be resolved by taking a stand on the nature of the universe, a stand similar to the one in physics, in which one accepts the worldview of classical or quantum physics.",,,English

But at the end of his intellectual itinerary, it reserves this concept the only religious belief. This raises the question of what becomes of the natural knowledge which previously constituted the transcendental condition of faith. A chronological study of the work of Bouillard reveals a significant displacement in his way of showing the rationality of faith. If it is initially seconded to the method of immanence Blondel to explain the ""logic of faith"", he seeks henceforth this logic by referring to the hermeneutic circle of belief and understanding in line with Saint Anselm. Door by the movement of the understanding of the faith, and initiating a dialogue with religion in general and agnostic philosophy of Eric Weil, it leads to establish a unique relationship between revelation and existence, which operates at three levels: experience of transcendence, religious experience and theological experience of faith. If the author seeks to demonstrate and rooting faith in human experience regarded in its entirety, this experience has also conditions his eyes access to the intelligence of faith and is a set of conditions of possibility of faith. Such change results in fact his tireless dialogue with surrounding culture increasingly secularized and marked by the presence of multiple religions. It is our author has opened his contemporaries a new access to the Christian faith in a changing world.",,,French

Considering selected fiction of the period in relation to changing urban contexts in London and drawing on urban studies and psychoanalytic frameworks, I argue that the metropolis and its inhabitants were subject to continuing transformations and a recurring process of abjection through the prevalence and effects of filth, moral degradation, poverty and death in the midand late nineteenth century. Abjection lurks in the everyday life of the Victorians as imagined in the literary works of Charles Dickens, George Gissing and Arthur Morrison, in realistic and often pessimistic ways, and it lingers in the spaces and new urban subjects of modernity. My thesis is divided into four chapters, addressing broad thematic and conceptual terms, helpful in understanding the Dickens, Gissing and Morrison's depictions of the city: filth and poverty, boundaries, ruins, and abject bodies. I focus on the period 1840–1890s to frame my argument, as this historical sweep allows us to see a range of increasing and shifting concerns about sanitation, overcrowding, slums and transgressing social boundaries, as represented in urban literature of the period. The fiction gets imagined, in part, through these on-going transformations. While previous critics writing on these novelists have emphasised some of these concerns, my work seeks to bring a new perspective through analysing the experience of abjection in everyday life in a transforming urban space like London. Each chapter raises specific questions about the ways abjection is registered in everyday life and how it is spatialised in Victorian London. What is the significance of impurity, danger, social class and boundaries in this process? Is the challenge against abjection productive and/or destructive? How does the fiction of Dickens, Gissing and Morrison help us interpret this challenge against the abject and the transformation of space? In examining these questions, I draw upon a range theorists and critics, in particular, Julia Kristeva's theory of abjection and subjectivity, and theories of space and everyday culture by Henri Lefebvre, Michel Foucault, Michel de Certeau, and Ben Highmore in addition to primary material related to the social and cultural history of Victorian London.",,,English

Moreover, even Roman Catholics who make Ignatian Exercises often are not spontaneously inclined to obey Roman ecclesiastical authority. Neither avoiding the ecclesial dimension nor an authoritarian ‘follow the rules!’ provides spiritual directors with adequate orientation when working with issues at Church frontiers. This dissertation in pastoral theology seeks to navigate a middle position by moving beyond the individualism and the a-historical assumptions of the existing relevant literature.|The dissertation remains close to the Ignatian primary sources, in the awareness that the Ignatian tradition needs to be constantly updated and that the contemporary ecclesial frontiers are not fully foreseen in the canonical texts. The main hypothesis is that a notion is needed of a ‘pilgrim Church’ in space and time, with Christians who are related to one another in a deep and fundamental sense. The minor hypothesis is that the individual needs to be open towards and prepared to learn from the Roman Catholic Church, in order to understand and to be profoundly moved by these exercises, but not necessarily to become a Roman Catholic.|Having presented and discussed various approaches in the writings of twentieth-century and recent thinkers, this thesis puts forward its own ecclesiological position informed by Charles Taylor, Hans-Georg Gadamer and Karl Rahner. The aim is to take Ignatian studies forward by combining relational anthropology, hermeneutics and a sacramental understanding of the Church, and to apply this synthesis to the practice of giving Ignatian Exercises. The final chapter discusses a selection of cases in the light of my ecclesiological position. The synthesis and application claim originality.",,,English

He wrote several works across different literary genres both in Spanish and Latin, but was best known for his popular works in Spanish: two miscellanies of natural philosophy, Curiosa filosofía (1630) and Oculta filosofía (1633); a catechism, the Práctica del catecismo romano (1640); his ascetical treatises, especially De la diferencia entre lo temporal y eterno (1640); and his ‘advice-books’ to princes and nobles, most notably Causa y remedio de los males públicos (1642).|As a member of the Jesuit Order, Nieremberg wrote these works with the intention to ‘save souls’, this being the main apostolic goal of the Society. While they provide people with knowledge (‘noticia’) – whether doctrinal, natural, spiritual, or political – these works teach readers to view human existence according to its true end: God’s will of salvation. All things of the temporal world are portrayed as a means to that end.|In order to accomplish this goal, Nieremberg incorporates elements from Loyola’s Ejercicios espirituales (1548), the spiritual foundation of the Jesuit Order, and develops a rhetorical strategy which encourages readers to discern the will of God in the world they inhabit. He also develops this rhetoric according to some of the principal literary and artistic conventions of the seventeenth century, and provides an important example of how a prominent Jesuit writer came to express the apostolic and spiritual principles of his Order, but in the language and imagery of Spain’s Siglo de Oro.",,,English

I craft the answer to this question by studying the Spiritual Exercises of Saint Ignatius of Loyola. I claim an analogy between the central dynamic of the thirty-day retreat, whose guidelines are in the book of the Spiritual Exercises, and four operative principles that ought to constitute the structure of formation programs for Jesuit schools' faculty and staff in the educational tradition, identity and mission of the Society of Jesus. The four operative principles are discernment, desire, diakonia and decision. Formation that aims at training partners in education to share in the common mission of Jesuit schools happens best when these four operative principles inform the curriculum design and when they interplay during the actual process of forming the educators who work in Jesuit schools. Discernment is the under-girding principle because the Society of Jesus is engaged in education to form women and men who can discern, that is to say, who can decide from their in-depth values, convictions and aspirations. Desire is the operative principle of the first movement of the Spiritual Exercises, which corresponds to the first week of the retreat. Diakonia--the Greek word for service--draws upon the second movement of the Exercises, which expands beyond the second week of the retreat into the third and fourth ones. This second movement is unified by the idea of being inspired by Jesus Christ or from ""outside"" of the retreatants. Lastly, decision is the third movement of the Spiritual Exercises. Ignatius invites the exercitants to make a personal choice of a state of life at the core of the second week of the retreat. But decision as operative principle accompanies the retreatants until the end of their thirty-day experience. The doctoral program of the Boston College Institute of Religious Education and Pastoral Ministry is in theology and education. The dissertation is an academic exercise in the field of pastoral or practical theology at the intersection of education, theology and the means of church education inspired by the Spiritual Exercises. Therefore, besides the analogical reading of Ignatius's work, my method consists of putting the aforementioned operative principles in conversation with a select review of literature in the fields of transformative and reflective adult education, developmental psychology, responsible and collaborative leadership, pastoral ministry and educational change.",,,English

Alessandro Piccolomini subjected mathematical demonstrations to a philosophical examination, and his new views evoked responses by contemporaries such as Francesco Barozzi, Benito Pereira and other Jesuit commentators.

While these components were modified in order to best suit the specific needs of the Huron, they had a direct link to the humanist pedagogical culture of Europe.

It does this by translating portions of the earliest (c. 1581) surviving presentation of Christian teachings written in Japanese, Nihon no Katekizumo (""A Catechism for Japan""). The catechism and encounter are analyzed using Michel Foucault's concept of ""episteme."" The introduction of Christianity into Japan, beginning in 1549, was a profound experience for both the Japanese people and the western missionaries. The Jesuit mission represented not only the first significant encounter with ""the West"" for the Japanese people and the first encounter with ""Japan"" for the missionaries, but it was the first significant encounter between a Christian episteme and a Japanese episteme. Nihon no Katekizumo is thought to be the oldest existing explanation of Christian doctrine in Japanese. It includes an informed critique of Japanese Buddhism and appears to have been composed by Jesuit missionaries for training Japanese students to be priests and missionaries in Japan. Analysis of the form and content of Nihon no Katekizumo suggests that the text was intended to persuade Japanese novices of not only the truth of Christian teachings, but also their superiority to Buddhist teachings. It provides criticism of Japanese religious teachings and an explanation of Christian doctrine. The use of many classical Chinese characters and technical Buddhist terms clearly suggests that Nihon no Katekizumo was prepared with an elite, Buddhist audience in mind. By translating and examining extant sections of Nihon no Katekizumo (the preface and the first chapter), this thesis discusses the episteme held by the Jesuit missionaries and how it functioned in their Japanese mission. Further, this thesis investigates how the Jesuits' use of the Japanese language to argue and assert their own episteme necessarily resulted in an encounter with another, Japanese Buddhist episteme, a kind of interaction that Foucault himself did not discuss in his writings.",,,English
