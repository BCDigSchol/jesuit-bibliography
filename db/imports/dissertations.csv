Dissertation,"Gotō, Tomoko",2000,Emergent Consciousness about the Self Depicted in the World Map Screens,Vancouver,University of British Columbia,"viii, 129",MA thesis,,,http://hdl.handle.net/2429/10620,,16th century|17th century,Arts -- Painting|Geography -- Cartography -- Maps,Asia -- Japan,"Fróis, Luís, 1532–1597|Ignatius, of Loyola, Saint, c.1491–1556","A pair of eight-fold screens entitled ""World-Map-and-Twenty-Eight-City"" represents a colorful world map with the figures of peoples of the world on one screen. The painting is punctuated by numerous city markers, with the largest indicating the city of Rome. On the other screen, twenty-eight cities of the world and Christian and Muslim kings in ceremonial attire on horseback are depicted. This pair of screens was probably produced in the early seventeenth century. It was most likely painted by Jesuit-trained Japanese painters who had learned western themes and painting techniques: perspective and chiaroscuro. Until the sixteenth century, Japanese experience with and knowledge of the world was limited to its neighbouring lands, such as China, Korea, and India. Beyond the realm of Japan lay worlds formed through fascination and the imagination. In 1543, however, this changed with the appearance of the Portuguese, who journeyed to Japan in the pursuit of new lands to develop trade and to spread Christianity. The Portuguese and their culture had a strong impact on Japanese thoughts and activities, including the creation of many screens with European motifs and new views of the world at large. This pair of screens was drawn upon Dutch prototype made by Petrus Kaerius (1571–1646) in 1609. In my thesis I will examine how ""World-Map-and-Twenty-Eight-City"" screens performed a two-fold function. I will first examine how the screens marked Jesuit propagation of Christianity in Japan, and second I will examine how the screens articulated what might be called an emergent sense of Japanese collective identity. By this I do not mean identity based on nationalism, which emerged in Japan only in the nineteenth century. Rather, I mean an increasing awareness of the Self in relation to Other, and not only in relation to those outside the geographic confines of Japan but also within. What I intend to explore is how definitions of geography and culture in world map screens, and specifically ""World-Map-and-Twenty-Eight-City"" screens, prompted viewers to acknowledge a more distinctive Self. The end of the sixteenth and the beginning of the seventeenth centuries was a transitional moment for both the Jesuits and Portugal. Religiously, the Jesuits were in conflict with the Japanese government and, as well their authority was undermined by Mendicants from the Philippines. These conflicts were compounded further by the spread of Protestantism in Europe. Similarly, after a short prosperous trade in Asia, rising economic and political power of the Netherlands and England gradually pushed Portuguese trade out of Asia. By comparing ""World-Map-and-Twenty-Eight-City"" screens with ""In-and-Around- Kyoto"" screens, I argued that the Jesuit's hidden agenda of glorifying Christendom and God's order on earth emerged. Moreover, by comparing this pair with ""Four-Continent-and- Forty-Eight-People"" screens, I detect the emergence of sense of a Japanese Self, that was forged in relation to the Europeans. Although the screens give the impression of the orderly and peaceful world, they mask the unstable situation which the Jesuits and Portugal were experiencing at the time. In the end, I propose that ""World-Map-and-Twenty-Eight-City"" screens transformed and reworked the Dutch prototype from a geographical mode to one that is highly decorative. Rather than articulating a Japanese view of the world, the screens maintained the notion of a powerful Catholic world.",,,English,REVIEW

During these years the colony served as a haven for hundreds of thousands who were fleeing Japanese expansion. A central aspect of Macau's war experience was the internal life of the colony. However, little or no published or archival material is available on this subject. Accordingly, the only feasible way to study this aspect of the territory's history is to draw on the testimony of those who in fact did experience wartime conditions in Macau. For the interview process, subjects were selected who belong to a distinct ethno-cultural group that has emerged from Macau's Portuguese and Chinese heritages - the Macanese. Besides the Macanese community resident in Macau, there are also several diasporic communities around the world. Many members of these communities spent the duration of the war in Macau as refugees, and the interview process clearly showed that members of the diasporic and resident Macanese communities had qualitatively different memories of the Second World War. Furthermore, the recollections of the Portuguese Jesuit priest Father Manuel Teixeira have played a prominent if idiosyncratic role in perceptions of Macau's Second World War experience, and so his testimony is discussed in relation to that of the Macanese. The way in which those interviewed expressed their perceptions of the past seemed to be rooted in and shaped by their experiences both before and since the war. Memory is, in other words, a construct. By analysing these narrated memories in terms of the existing theoretical literature on oral history and collective memory, this thesis strives to shed light on the connections between experience, memory, and the construction of the Second World War in the resident and diasporic Macanese communities.",,,English,REVIEW

The study charts shifts in technology, working methods, feminist issues, and the notion of an alternative media practice within the United States, focusing mainly on feminist media projects from 1990 forward. The study also situates these projects in the larger contexts of the history of avantgarde cinema, video art, and the art world, illustrating links to the poststructuralist tactics of appropriation, narrative experimentation, and identity subversion that characterize feminist artwork in general. The study also tackles the ways in which contemporary feminist media artists are continuing to grapple with how to understand and resist the sense of political and social disorientation that in the early 1990s helped reduce what remained of a feminist movement to near non-existence. Another issue asks where, as the entertainment, telecommunication, and international business industries continue to merge, should political resistance occur? Underlying these larger political questions is the ongoing project of rethinking the subject, dramatically questioned in terms of the matrix of race, class, and gender in 1960s experimental film and video and now reconfigured with attention to phenomenological inflections of the wcrld around us, and to technology. A third issue is that of the body, now understood to be thoroughly imbricated in technology such that the boundary separating body and machine has become malleable, with one the supplement to the other. While much attention has been paid in feminist analysis to the political insurgency of the notion of the cyborg, the complex interconnectedness of the body, both physical and psychic, within an increasingly altered conception of space and time",,,English,REVIEW

The essence underlying a large body of his poetry was his Catholic religion. His early religious poetry utilized nature-based metaphors to express his love of Christ and trace the immanence of God within nature. He borrowed heavily from the aesthetics of Pater and the philosophy of Duns Scotus. The dissertation explores these early influences and assesses their contribution to the formation of a unique religious interpretation of life and the formulation of an aesthetic congruent with this religion. The dissertation dissects early symptoms of religious doubt within his poetry and finally analyses his ""Terrible Sonnet"" phase in detail to ascertain whether the crisis so often described as occurring during this period was religious or merely reflected a loss of creative ability.",,,English,REVIEW

It is also an attempt to place Native peoples at the center of a narrative about the historical development of the continent. This dissertation argues that the western interior remained indigenous and autonomous until the late 19th century, in spite of European and Euro-American claims of possession and sovereignty. It further contends that the Native peoples who migrated between the indigenous west and the colonial east significantly influenced the process of colonization in Canada and the Great Lakes, and significantly impacted the development of social structures and categories in the larger Atlantic World. In this story Native peoples do not lose themselves in a New World that is not of their own making.

Dissertation,"Fitterer, Robert J.",2004,Bernard Lonergan's Cognitive Theory and Aristotelian Phronesis: Toward a Conception of Performative Objectivity in Virtue Ethics,,University of British Columbia,,PhD diss.,,,http://circle.ubc.ca/handle/2429/15894,,,Philosophy -- Ethics|Philosophy -- Theory of Knowledge,,"Lonergan, Bernard J. F., 1904–1984","Virtue ethics bases moral decision-making, in part, in a skills-like ability to spot morally salient features in the phenomenal world. Aristotle, an exemplar of such ethics, developed a theory of practical wisdom (phronesis) wherein the person of moral expertise makes sound ethical judgments and decisions via direct insight into concrete circumstances. Phronesis involves emotive discernment and agent-relative construal of the world. But emotions and perspectives can also be linked with bias and poor judgment. How are we to think about objectivity if virtue ethics relies upon such apparently subjective factors as emotively influenced dispositions? Bernard Lonergan developed a theory of insight-based human understanding and explores its operation in the concrete circumstances of practical living. His theory offers a process of human learning and knowing that does not avoid emotions and agent-perspectives but seeks to so operate within these factors as to produce a state we could validly call 'being objective.' Agreeing with Aristotle on a key role for emotions, Lonergan goes much further in claiming that some mode of the emotion of love should play a critical role in attaining the insights required for virtue ethics. His treatment of love, however, remains vague. Martha Nussbaum, on the other hand, provides very rich treatment of how love, understood as compassion, can act as a control for perspectival discernment and moral insight. Her theory fills out Lonergan's, allowing us more clearly to see how love (and other emotions) could be conducive to fostering objective viewpoints within morally charged circumstances. Objectivity in virtue ethics can be understood, then, to be what we are more or less attaining to the degree that we self-consciously apprehend and deploy our innate modes of insight-induction and aim these cognitive processes toward a world construed by a background concern of care and compassion.",,,English,REVIEW

In accordance with the wishes of the Holy See, the Jesuits intend to establish the Catholic Churches of the Orient and also to fight against protestant missions. After 1850 they also got France's support; it provided the mission with a mean for extending its influence in the Orient. In Syria, the Jesuits settled in Mont-Lebanon, then in Beirut and Saida. Closely scrutinized by the oriental clergy, subjected to the demands of their protectors (pashas, consuls, emirs) they particularly devoted themselves to teaching and to the spiritual care of Catholics living near their residences and from 1860 they nearly gave up all apostolate to the other Christians or Muslims of the Orient. At the end of the 19th century, many clerics of the oriental Catholic Churches had graduated from Ghazir's college-seminary which the Jesuits opened in 1846. Through the creation of communities of nuns who devoted themselves to the girls' education, the Jesuits had a part in the transformation of the women's role in the Oriental society.

Konishi Ryusa emerges as an atypical character, whose knowledge and appreciation for a foreign credo brought him to be wealthy and well connected. He was the bow from which his sons sprung by projecting their images on the historical screen of Japan's past. Ryusa was in effect the sponsor and the cause for Yukinaga's success in life. Yet, Yukinaga remains a controversial character in Japanese history because nothing much is left than few records. Most of his family documents were destroyed or lost, as Japan was engulfed in civil wars, factional rivalries and destruction. Yukinaga was involved in the territorial unification struggles, as his job was to connect peripheral areas, like the Seto Inland Sea, to the central government represented by Toyotomi Hideyoshi. Yukinaga's father, Ryusa, also worked for Hideyoshi once he became the ruler of central Japan. Ryusa's acquaintance with the Jesuit Fathers and his consequent adoption of Christianity, a foreign religion, brought to him and to his family spiritual, practical and political advantages. For Ryusa, the spiritual advantages were less visible as Christianity was still in an early stage, but his contact with the Jesuits opened the way to the Portuguese merchants, enhancing his business relations. His mercantile experience brought him to get acquainted with local political power hubs. His son, Yukinaga reaped the benefits of his father's position, and being a skilled warrior he raised higher close to Hideyoshi's power. Yukinaga for his integrity was often described as model for Christian conversion, but remained a samurai in the ""Land of the Kami"". He embodied both western cultural expansion and Japanese militaristic ambitions proper of the last stages of the period of the civil wars. Hence, this study aims at a re-appraisal of both Konishi Ryusa, as a merchant and Yukinaga as new types of men, possessing not only technical and military knowledge, but also a commercial know-how. They applied new technology and ideas brought in by the Portuguese and missionaries literally navigating on the monsoon winds. My aim is to focus particularly on their adoption of Christianity, as it was perceived in sixteenth century Japan, and on how they applied it in their lives. Although my research includes Ryusa as one of the leader of the Christian movement in Kyoto and Nagasaki, my focus will be mainly on Konishi Yukinaga, whose brilliant career as a warrior led him to become a Great Admiral. He used Christianity as a political tool in the Seto Insland Sea area, still a peripheral area ruled by pirates and warlords. It was in this stretch of Sea that important cultural contact between Japan and the rest of the world occurred. From there Japan exercised its domestic and international authority in the attempt to create a new order in East Asia. Yukinaga's work in the Seto Insland Sea demonstrated the existence of a power gap between peripheries and the not yet stabilized centrality of the Japanese Government, whose expansionistic aim was to put under control peripheral but strategic areas in order to regulate its domestic and international relations. Although Konishi Yukinaga took part in Toyotomi Hideyoshi's adoption of an international aggressive diplomatic policy, used by Japan to face western economic expansion in Asia, he embodied the will to negotiate and to mediate at its best. His brilliant character, neglected and perhaps misinterpreted throughout the centuries, is revealed through his work as a mediator, as he was willing to persuade and to compromise in order to reach a situation where there were only winners. It relates perhaps the story of a man whose values lingered between the old and the new, almost as a ""renaissance"" type of man, for a Japanese renaissance that never took off.",,,English,REVIEW

It argues that French domestic politics and increasing European competition for influence in the Ottoman Empire encouraged a reprisal of the Jesuit mission by both the government and the order. As a result of both domestic and international pressure the Jesuits gradually redefined their mission from one that emphasized evangelism to a politicized Catholicism attached to nationalism. A central assertion of this dissertation, therefore, is that political and religious categories were open to interpretation, and synthesis. Terms such as Republican, clerical, anti-clerical, and French were negotiated by the Jesuits and French officials and Parisian ministries in Ottoman Syria. The creation of the University of Saint-Joseph medical school, coupled with Catholic organs such as the Oeuvre de la Propagation de la Foi, gave Jesuits a platform from which to affirm, assert and reconfigure French patriotism.

Although officially open to all ethnic groups, private academies have resulted in the de-facto segregation of many rural areas. One important consequence of this dual school system is that local school funding referendums often fail because those residents whose children attend private schools are unwilling to increase their own taxes to improve public schools. In smaller rural communities, this often results in two inadequately funded schools - one private academy with one or two hundred students dependent on tuition funding, and a public school funded with inadequate local tax rates. We hypothesize that there are significant differences between older, more established private schools (for example a 100 year old Jesuit school), and a small southern ""academy"" to subvert integration. We use dummy variables to capture this difference, allowing the effect of attendance at a small academy to differ from the effect of a public school. The null hypothesis to be tested is that established private schools and the ""segregation academies"" have the same effect on Test Improvement and Income. If we fail to reject we will conclude that parents had the same motivation to send their children to attend southern private academies as parents who sent their children to other schools had - a better education. Rejection of the null hypothesis will lead us to conclude that there were different motivations.",,,English,REVIEW

It seeks to show how their meeting, resulting in von Balthasar’s seminal study The Theology of Karl Barth, goes on to influence von Balthasar’s theological development throughout his trilogy beginning with The Glory of the Lord, continuing in the Theo-Drama and concluding with the Theo-Logic. In particular it explores the significance of the debate over the ‘analogy of being’ and seeks to show that von Balthasar’s decision to structure his trilogy around the transcendentals of ‘being’, the beautiful, the good and the true, results from his re-affirmation of the role of analogy in light of his debate with Barth. It will also suggest that von Balthasar’s adoption of a ‘theo-dramatic’ approach to God’s saving action and assertion of the role of Church as a ‘theo-dramatic character’ in her own right is prompted by concern over what he alleges to be ‘christological constriction’ and an inadequate doctrine of the Church in Barth. This argument will be conducted in dialogue with other theologians and interpreters of von Balthasar and conclude with a personal reflection on how the issues raised remain relevant today.",,,English,REVIEW

Le luthéranisme relie étroitement christologie et sotériologie, en donnant du salut une définition christologique qui tient lieu de critère. Or, pour pouvoir reconnaître les religions du monde comme autant de «voies de salut» dans leur altérité irréductible, Dupuis semble déconstruire le lien entre ce qu’est Jésus-Christ et ce qu’est le salut: son «inclusivisme pluraliste» revient à juxtaposer une christologie haute de type inclusiviste et une sotériologie pluraliste.| |Jacques Dupuis’ ""Christian theology of religious pluralism"" is an attempt at combining loyalty to the Roman Catholic official dogma with an earnest acknowledgment of the divine origin of the world’s religions. This theology is examined here from an ecumenical point of view, through a Lutheran interpretation of the way Dupuis comments and criticizes his sources— Scripture, the Fathers of the Church, contemporary theology, especially Karl Rahner’s, and other theologies of religions. Lutheran theology closely binds together christology and soteriology, providing a christological definition of salvation, which it regards as a criterion. In order to acknowledge the world’s religions as ""ways of salvation"" in their very differences, Dupuis seems to disconnect what Jesus Christ is from what salvation is: his ""pluralistic inclusivism"" ultimately turns into superposition of a high inclusivist christology with a pluralistic soteriology.",,,French,REVIEW

Aleni's instructions on practical learning were highly selective out of medieval Aristotelian-Thomist traditions, and subtly adaptive to classical Confucian thought, while Fujian converts responded with their reinterpretations (or misinterpretations) of classical sources and Jesuit sciences to shape a new Christian-Confucian identity. As for the spiritual and moral learning, Aleni and Fujian converts likewise involved in dynamic negotiations between Catholic doctrines and Confucian teaching by frequently shifting among different voices. Their dialogues revealed a tendency to create mutually acceptable ideas and to actualize them through filial piety to God the Great Father-Mother and parents, good works, and an interiorized contemplative life merging Ignatian spirituality and Confucian sincerity. In addition, many episodic, daily instructions of the Jesuit masters in Fujian were accompanied by visual representations of a hybrid Christian-Confucian identity. Objects, images, and rituals by means of reproduction and reinterpretation found their way to show up in Fujian socio-religious landscape, despite the growing opposition of anti-Christians. With interactive exchanges structured by a self-other relation, Christian and Chinese representations coexisted to shape a harmonious reality, visible and practicable.|Based on the literary and cultural inquiry of later Ming Christian dialogism, this dissertation argues that Kouduo richao should be taken as a representative record of Aleni's Fujian mission with his consistent employment of both the intellectual and the religious. It exemplifies a macroscopic but substantial study of the Sino-Western encounter under the new theory dialogic hybridization, which leads to an integration of previous approaches, and through the underpinning trajectory from dialogue to the dialogic, helps a better understanding of China's past intercultural experience.",,,English,REVIEW

The Swiss Catholic theologian Hans Urs von Balthasar (1905–1988) is distinctive among contemporary theologians for his discussion of truth: both for the importance he gives to the topic and for his understanding of the nature of truth. This dissertation focuses on Balthasar's trinitarian vision of truth. In his three-volume Theologik, Balthasar considers inner-worldly truth, divine truth, and the relation between the two. According to Balthasar, the incarnate Son is the fullest manifestation of God in the world. Through the Son the world comes to know the Father. The revelation of the Son must then be interpreted by the Spirit, who enables believers to comprehend and to live the fullness of the divine truth that has been disclosed. The divine truth is revealed must profoundly as trinitarian love. For this reason, the truth of God is best expressed in the world in the lived existence of a person: Christ. One chapter of this study examines the philosophical foundation for Balthasar's theology of truth as it is presented in Theo-Logic I. Three separate chapters are devoted to Balthasar's theology of truth and take their organization from the trinitarian structure of his vision, i.e., Christ as the truth of God, the Holy Spirit as Spirit of truth, and the Father as the invisible ground of truth. The next chapter contains a comparison of Balthasar's understanding of truth with the proposal offered by the American Lutheran theologian Bruce Marshall (b. 1955) in his book Trinity and Truth . Marshall develops a trinitarian understanding of truth in dialogue with analytic philosophy. The comparison facilitates consideration of Balthasar's place in the broad spectrum of contemporary thought by reflecting on the relation between his ideas and some ideas from the recent analytic tradition. The final chapter offers an integrative summary and a critical evaluation of Balthasar's theology of truth.",,,English,REVIEW

This knowledge was reflected in several published and unpublished natural histories, as well as in herbals and letters that circulated among the members of the Society of Jesus. Although the production of knowledge about the natural world was not one of the stated goals of the Society of Jesus in South America, the work of José de Acosta (1540–1600), Bernabé Cobo (1580–1657), Alonso de Ovalle (1601–1651), Diego de Rosales (1603–1677) or Nicolás Mascardi (1624–1673), among others, demonstrate that the study of American nature was constant during the seventeenth century. All of them made their contributions to the study of American nature while fulfilling academic, pastoral or administrative duties within the different Jesuit missions and colleges in Peru, Chile, Bolivia, Argentina, and Paraguay. The variety of tasks that these South American Jesuits carried out allows us to understand the importance that the study of nature had for the spiritual, pastoral, missionary, and political goals of the Society of Jesus in South America. In this dissertation, I trace the links of Jesuit science in South America with contemporary scientific ideas and practices in Europe, as well as with native knowledge about the natural world. At the same time, I study how the colonial condition of South America shaped the institutional development of the order, which made possible the production of scientific knowledge by its members. By studying the natural histories written by the Jesuits in South America, I aim both to re-inscribe the science produced in the Spanish colonies within the larger frame of current debates about seventeenth century Jesuit science, and to understand the centrality that the study of nature had for the Jesuit educational and missionary agenda.",,,English,KEEP

By contrast, the theology of early Vietnamese Christianity has received little attention. The question of theological content is important since understanding it is critical to forming a view of what, exactly, early Vietnamese Christians believed and how those beliefs relate both to pre-Christian belief systems in Vietnam as well as Roman Catholic orthodoxy as it was construed at the time of Christianity's implantation in seventeenth-century Vietnam. This dissertation examines twelve of the earliest Vietnamese Christian liturgical and doctrinal texts in order to reconstruct the early Vietnamese Church's understanding of Christianity's central figure. Jesus of Nazareth. These texts, written in the classical Vietnamese Nôm script, are predominantly attributed to the Jesuit missionary Geronimo Maiorica (1589–1656). The discussion of the Maiorica texts' Christology in Chapter Four is preceded by treatment of three topics which serve to contextualize the subject. First, a brief biography of Geronimo Maiorica is offered. Second, Maiorica's Nôm works are identified. The date and authorship of the texts used in this dissertation is substantiated through the analysis of missionary records, documented archival studies, obvious in-text attributions of authorship and date, theological lexicon, and time-specific peculiarities in methods of forming Nôm characters. Third, the methods by which the Maiorica texts were composed and subsequently transmitted to the present by a process of hand-copying is analyzed. This study shows that while the Christ of the Maiorica texts is recognizably similar to the Christ of contemporary Jesuit teachings in Europe, several notable modifications to seventeenth-century Jesuit Christology were made for the sake of the Vietnamese audience. First, the Jewish prophetic tradition was consistently undervalued, with the result that Jesus, though still a savior of mankind, is no longer depicted as the fulfillment of Old Testament prophesy. Second, the physical and social environment in which Jesus lived and worked takes on Vietnamese characteristics. Third, the texts embellish their account of Jesus with attributes of authority and power thought congenial to the Vietnamese audience.",,,English,REVIEW

This paper examines two instances of Jesuit missionary translation work in seventeenth-century China: Matteo Ricci's ""Tianzhu shiyi"" (The True Meaning of the Lord of Heaven) (1603), a work written in Chinese for a Chinese audience, and the ""Confucius Sinarum Philosophus"" (1687), earliest published translation of three of the Confucian Four Books into Latin for a European audience. These two important works situate the missionaries between cultures—not as passive intermediaries, but as creators of a Christian-Confucian hybridity. More than locating points of equivalency of meaning, the Jesuit translators emphasized certain aspects of an older form of Confucianism that they saw as compatible with Christianity, and they reinterpreted both belief systems in ways that would appeal to each audience while avoiding the criticism of their European superiors as well as Chinese officials and supporters. By examining not only the effects of both source and target cultures on the creation of the ""Tianzhu shiyi"" and ""Confucius Sinarum Philosophus,"" but also the influence of the two texts on their respective audiences, this project argues for a broader understanding of what constitutes translation and sheds light on this unique historical encounter between European Jesuits and Chinese elites.",,,English,KEEP

By relying upon a definition of redemption that simultaneously considers spiritual deliverance with material recovery, the Americas become, at once, interpretable as contested grounds and promised destinations. Following Chapter One, the ""Introduction"" to this project, Chapter Two provides the methodological foundation, describing theoretical approaches towards a definition of redemption that will serve as the underlying basis for my argument. The following chapters all apply redemption in readings of films that may be categorized as captivity narratives. Chapter Three considers how Bruce Beresford's 1991 film, Black Robe, utilizes redemption in its depiction of a Jesuit priest's interactions with Indigenous groups (such as the Huron and Iroquois) in seventeenth-century French Canada. Chapter Four examines redemption in the Brazilian film Como Era Gostoso o Meu Frances (Nelson Pereira dos Santos, 1971). This film about a nameless Frenchman's captivity among the sixteenth-century Tupinambas, illustrates the ways in which redemption has functioned, and continues to function, as a foundational contributor to colonial and nationalist projects. Chapter Five focuses on Cabeza de Vaca (Echevarria, 1991), a Mexican film recounting Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca's historic sixteenth-century trek across much of North America. The spiritual focus of this film is studied in terms of how it both challenges and corroborates the historical Cabeza de Vaca's own accounts of redemption. Chapter Six considers filmic representations of borders and border crossings, thereby examining how the Americas become shaped by distinction and congruence, how the terrain of this hemisphere becomes, at once, the ever receding Promised Land and a space in dire need of redemption and exorcism. The French film Le Salaire de la peur (Clouzot, 1953) is here compared to the German film Aguirre, der Zorn Gottes (Herzog, 1973) in an attempt to elucidate how both of these texts create senses of displacement through their associations of the Americas with perdition.

It also brought about diverse and often unforeseen reactions. In order to face the new challenge initiated by the missionaries, the natives observed, appraised and invented new ways to become part of this new order originating in the Western world without jeopardizing their own traditions which they felt were essential to their historic destiny. For them, it meant ensuring the survival of their identity, through strategic choices in the face of threatening ""modern ways"" imposed on them by the outside world and within a political and economic context that was both restrictive and oppressive. Above all, they tried to avoid a head-on collision which would have been fatal to them.

Engaging debates about Indian-White relations, borderlands, colonial identities, and the nature of empires in early America, it draws on published and archival materials from French, British, Spanish and American sources. The Creole villages of Illinois Country, from their beginnings as illegal fur trade outposts, became thriving agricultural villages with a population of 1500 by the 1750s. Yet these remote colonies had contentious relations with colonial governments that tried to control the early Mississippi Valley. At the center of this dissertation are questions about community and identity on the frontier of empires. From the start, settlers went to Illinois for reasons that clashed with the agenda of the French authorities, threatening to become autonomous and separate from the imperial system. Jesuits created a mission where they spoke Illinois languages and refused to frenchify their Indian charges. Robert La Salle made in Illinois the first piece of an ""imaginary kingdom""---a new fur trade empire which promised to compete with the interests of New France. Meanwhile, fur traders went to pursue their own interests outside the restrictive regulations of New France, engaging in illegal trade, marrying Indian women, and eventually farming. By the time Louisiana authorities began to exercise authority over Illinois, immigration reshaped the colony, but the local community in Illinois preserved a reputation for autonomy and even independence. Approaching this frontier community, imperialists worried about the loyalty of the people who lived there, as colonists actively protected local interests and patterns. The result was a distinctive empire by collaboration in Illinois Country. Attempting to reconstruct the community and convert its inhabitants into loyal subjects at the end of the French regime, British and Spanish administrators arriving in Illinois in the 1760s attempted new policies of bordering and control on the Mississippi River. Meanwhile, the Creole colonists strategically negotiated the new imperial requirements as they attempted to preserve local patterns intact.",,,English,REVIEW

En tant que réalisateur, scénariste et théoricien du cinéma, Ruiz propose une réflexion théorique originale sur son médium, réflexion qui fait appel à plusieurs champs du savoir et met en relief les relations entre diverses pratiques artistiques. Le caractère multidisciplinaire de sa démarche expliquerait en partie la difficulté qu'éprouvent les critiques à aborder l'ensemble de l'oeuvre de Ruiz, qui paraét inclassable en termes d'écoles, de genres ou d'esthétiques cinématographiques. Trois vies et une seule mort, généralement ignoré dans les ouvrages consacrés à Ruiz, a pour particularité d'esquisser des liens entre l'art de la mémoire et le cinéma. Bien que les oeuvres Mémoires des apparences et Le Temps retrouvé, réalisées par le même cinéaste, témoignent également des possibilités qu'offre le médium cinématographique pour traduire la mémoire, Trois vies et une seule mort est le seul film de Ruiz axé sur la mémoire qui ne soit pas l'adaptation d'une oeuvre littéraire. Créée et scénarisée par Ruiz, l'oeuvre étudiée porte sur l'art de la mémoire, emprunte certaines de ses caractéristiques formelles et propose une expérience spectatorielle sollicitant un constant «travail de mémoire». Trois vies et une seule mort établit ainsi de puissantes relations entre le caractère «défamiliarisant» (Victor Chklovski) de l'image cinématographique, le processus de réminiscence et les «traces d'oralité» (d'après la conception de l'oralité proposée par Walter J.

This revolution involved the confrontation between two divergent ethical rules employed by a person confronting a doubtful moral issue: the medieval rule that one should for safety's sake follow the law rather than the choice of his or her conscience (Tutiorism) and the modern rule that one should embrace the moral freedom of a conscience to follow even the less plausible of two probable opinions (Probabilism). Although this liberalization originated as a practical way to alleviate the dubious conscience of medieval penitents in the context of sacramental confession, Probabilism profoundly affected the early modern prince, lawyer, physician, merchant and scholar in the daily performance of their civil duties. To analyze this crucial transition, I have compiled the first exhaustive census of nearly 800 titles on sacramental confession by early modern Jesuits. The dissertation also focuses on a document in which the interaction of casuistry with the 'spoils of Egypt'---a biblical expression used in the Jesuit Constitutions to indicate classical pagan literature---can be traced: the codification of Jesuit pedagogy known as Ratio studiorum (1599). A comparison of the three superseded versions of the Ratio clearly suggests how systematic contact with Greco-Roman literature, and especially with Ciceronian rhetoric, may have influenced the Jesuit conscience to abandon Tutiorism and espouse Probabilism.",,,English,KEEP

Devido à ausência dos esposos por motivo de morte, ou das saídas da população masculina para o sertão e o litoral, as mulheres passavam a ter maior autonomia na administração do patrimônio familiar. A principal idéia desse mestrado é a de que as mulheres senhoriais paulistas faziam parte de um grupo sócio-econômico muito diversificado. No entanto, algumas delas conseguiam constituir excedentes econômicos e formavam um poder intermediário entre a população escrava indígena e os senhores.

Although it has been more than twenty-five years since the first study questioned the validity of the GRE for older students, state universities as well as private universities continue to use it as a primary factor in admissions. This study explored graduate admissions requirements and procedures for older female students in the 25 Jesuit institutions that offer graduate programs in education. Potential participants received a survey by mail. Participants are those admissions personnel who returned their survey. Names of potential participants were taken from the institutions' websites, or were gathered by contacting the graduate school to obtain names of those involved in the admissions process. The use of follow-up telephone interviews was employed to gain a greater understanding of answers given on the surveys. These occurred when the participant listed their phone number and agreed to be contacted for additional information. Data was also gathered by visiting websites from the Jesuit institutions. The study was conducted during Saint Louis University's fall, 2005 semester.|The study showed that admissions requirements vary from institution to institution. It also showed that the GRE remains as an important component of the admissions decision even though many of the respondents expressed some confusion with the interpretation of the scoring process especially pertaining to raw scores, summed scores and cut-off scores. The responses also demonstrated that the GRE Guide to the Use of Scores , published annually by the GRE was not utilized as it was intended. The study also showed that admissions personnel have limited, if any knowledge of validity studies regarding GRE scores and older female students.

It is not merely a doctrinal issue, but at the heart of our understanding of God, human being, and the total constitution of our world-view. Indeed, it is the place in which most of the horizons of theological subject matters are converged and diverged. Concerning the debate between the two competing views on God's eternity, the absolute timelessness in classical theism and the temporal everlastingness in contemporary panentheism, the purpose of this study is to present an alternative Trinitarian analogical understanding of God's eternity and its relation to time, especially, through a critical reflection of K. Barth's and H. U. von Balthasar's understandings, which can provide helpful resources for thinking further the debate on the timeless/everlasting eternity of God.|That is, while critically reviewing very diverse contemporary views on the topic, my particular concern is how we can simultaneously grasp not only the infinite qualitative difference but also the positive relationship between God's eternity and time in a proper way. In my view, it can be accomplished through reconceiving not only the nature of time but also that of God's eternity in a Trinitarian and analogical way. In other words, neither via negationis (i.e., timeless view) nor via eminentiae (i.e., everlasting view) can properly conceive the biblical teaching of the qualitative difference and the positive relationship between God's eternity and time. Therefore, a kind of via analogia through the following Trinitarian triple analogy, analogia vitae, analogia relationis, and analogia communicationis, centered in the only true God-given analogy, Jesus Christ, is the key to a proper conception of the biblical teaching of God's eternity and its positive relation to time. This analogical approach, which is based on a dynamic and dramatic concept of God's Being-as-life-in-relation and the Triune God's communicative action in eternity and time, can help us in solving the problem of the debate between the absolute timeless eternity and the temporal everlasting duration.",,,English,REVIEW

F., 1904–1984|Ignatius, of Loyola, Saint, c.1491–1556|Rahner, Karl, 1904–1984","The underlying, operative question of my entire project concerns the formal relationship of 'spirituality' to ethics. I contend that spiritual experience is normative for ethics: one's elected worldview orders feeling-values according to an appropriated scale of preference. To analyze the normative influence of spiritual experience on feeling-values, I begin by defining the term spirituality and then use an article written by Karl Rahner as a framework for identifying a particular form of ethics. I then examine the thought of Bernard Lonergan for an adequate account of subjectivity. With a viable anthropology in place, I examine Ignatius of Loyola's Spiritual Exercises to understand the normative function of spiritual experience. I conclude with a case study from Dorothy Day's The Long Loneliness that illustrates how spiritual experience functions as a normative source for moral-decision making.|A few important implications emerge. First, spirituality and spiritual experience are not a distinct, superfluous realm separate from the moral. To the contrary, spiritual experience is central to any discussion of values, and therefore, of ethics. Second, religious experience, like any other subjective data, must be understood, judged, and chosen if it is to be reliable. As data emerging from the realm of interiority, it should not be categorically dismissed as erratic, random, unintelligible, overly emotional, or exclusively subjective. Third, since values attach to worldviews, it is important for the ethicist to examine the way particular worldviews assemble scales of preference with regard to feeling-values. Furthermore, it is also important for the ethicist to understand how worldviews relate to each other: genetically, complementarily, or dialectically. Fourth, given transcendental method and the criteria for authentic subjectivity, there is a means to address the dialectic relationship of worldviews.",,,English,REVIEW

Violence of this scale and severity seems almost beyond our comprehension. However, a scenario of exactly these hideous proportions played out in southwestern Japan almost four centuries years ago. After a generation of peace in Japan, in 1637 peasants on Kyushu Island in southern Japan, distraught over horrible treatment at the hands of cruel lords, killed the local magistrate and took control of their village. The rebellion soon spread as peasants in village after village rose up against the taxation and collection methods that left them destitute, starving, and subject to routine torture. Christianity, introduced a century earlier by Portuguese Jesuits, re-emerged as a rallying ideology for the peasants whose numbers swelled to over 30,000. Within just a few weeks the Tokugawa Shogun, the central authority in early modern Japan, assembled and deployed an army of perhaps 150,000 soldiers to Kyushu (750 miles from the capital in present-day Tokyo) to confront the rebel peasants who took refuge in an abandoned castle. After a three-month siege, the castle fell to the central government army, and a general slaughter followed as almost 30,000 Japanese peasants were beheaded, burnt, or drowned. This dissertation examines the mechanics of how the Tokugawa were able to project military and political authority by fielding one of the largest, and potentially forceful, armies in the early modern world to confront and massacre their own subjects. It details the military, political, and economic apparatus used by the Tokugawa to mobilize, equip, and deploy an army greater than any European state could have at that time. This study will argue that the ability to maintain tremendous logistical ability, even during prolonged periods without war, underpinned the Tokugawa ability to project power, and thereby impose their authority on Japan for over two centuries.",,,English,REVIEW

Scholars have recognized that a dramatic compositional shift occurred between the second and third settings, but have provided no cogent explanation for the change. Most reasons given revolve around the Council of Trent, which held its final session in 1563. However, a consideration of the history and religious contexts of the works discloses other, possibly better explanations. I propose that the primary influence leading to Lasso's compositional shift was the liturgical reform initiated by his employer, Duke Wilhelm V, and enforced by the Jesuit priest Walram Tumler. These reforms had a profound effect on all facets of worship in Bavaria, most notably music. Recognizing the influence of the Jesuits on Lasso's music makes it possible to understand the composer's dramatic change in style.",,,English,KEEP

The thesis examines their views on the significance of studying mathematics, on mathematical demonstrations and on mathematical objects. The debate on the certitudo mathematicarum is given particular attention; the thesis tries to ascertain its nature and its causes. Alessandro Piccolomini subjected mathematical demonstrations to a philosophical examination, and his new views evoked responses by contemporaries such as Francesco Barozzi, Benito Pereira and other Jesuit commentators. The thesis studies how this debate was connected to Averroistic Aristotelianism and the revival of Proclus and his philosophy of mathematics. The thesis also suggests the close relationship between epistemological considerations and ontological concerns in the philosophy of mathematics.",,,French,REVIEW

Esteticamente, a meravigliosa dialética jesuítica coloca em cena, em cada canto e recanto da mata atlântica, aspectos do teatro popular, o uso do espaço cotidiano dos espectadores, a fala em sua língua, o escracho com seus costumes, os mimos, jeitos e trejeitos das personagens do Mal em contradição com a seriedade das personagens do Bem, dos anjos e santos. Em cena, como síntese, uma representação ao mesmo tempo religiosa e popular, sagrada e profana com aspectos cômicos e sérios, personagens divinas contracenando com personagens de carne e osso (caraíbas amigos dos padres, índios cristianizados, velhas índias, morubixabas, rudes colonos, mestiços...). Ideologicamente inspirado nos Exercícios Espirituais de Inácio de Loyola, o mentor e fundador da Companhia de Jesus, Anchieta cria um teatro a serviço da Igreja para convocar os moradores do Brasil para a luta contra a bandeira do Mal, Satanás, Lúcifer, Lutero, Calvino, os caraíbas e pajés - a Babilônia, e, principalmente, a dramática luta do espírito para vencer os desejos da carne e do coração. Neste jogo, a representação oculta nas sombras das alegorias, a verdadeira razão de ser dessa luta: trazer as almas dos índios, dos colonos, dos meninos dos colégios para a Igreja Católica, para a Companhia de Jesus. No tablado a vitória é do Bem, dos jesuítas, versus o Mal, a religião antiga, as idéias peregrinas... Em outras palavras, Loyola e depois Anchieta, forjado pelos Exercícios, desenvolvem um instrumento poderoso, a representação, para ensinar o caminho para as almas peregrinas brasileiras encontrarem a verdadeira vida, a eterna, na Jerusalém Celeste, na Cidade de Deus.",,,Portuguese,REVIEW

O objeto central de análise é um livro escolar publicado no Rio de Janeiro em 1883, o Manual de Estilo, de V. Sá de Menezes. Escrito para, segundo esclarece seu autor no prefácio, ""habilitar"" os alunos na ""prática da redação"", o livro se trata de uma versão em síntese do conteúdo presente nos manuais de retórica em circulação nas escolas do período. Em busca de entendimento sobre a tradição do ensino retórico com que o livro dialoga, parte-se de observações sobre os tipos de atividades de escrita propostas no Ratio studiorum, método de ensino seguido pela ordem dos jesuítas e que representa algo do que seria o ensino de escrita entre os séculos XVI e XVIII; posteriormente fazem-se considerações sobre a orientação pombalina para o ensino de retórica e de Língua Portuguesa. No capítulo 2, centrando-se então sobre o século XIX, busca-se um panorama da situação em que estariam se organizando o ensino primário e secundário brasileiro, a fim de entender-se o Manual de estylo em sua realidade de existência. A partir daí o trabalho concentra-se na leitura analítica do livro, o que corresponde aos capítulos 3 e 4 da tese, nos quais se discute a presença de uma concepção de linguagem como expressão do pensamento, as repercussões geradas por ela quanto ao tipo de ensino proposto por esse e outros livros didáticos do período e, no âmbito dos gêneros e tipologia textual, a presença da tipologia ?descrição, narração, carta?. Esta tipologia conduz as atividades de escrita do Manual de estylo e de uma série de livros de composição e manuais de português entre os anos finais do século XIX e iniciais do século XX, aspecto sobre o qual traçamos uma série de observações. A constatação do predomínio dessa tipologia para o ensino de produção textual nos leva à hipótese de que a tipologia ""descrição, narração, dissertação"" no universo escolar teria presença somente a partir do século XX, ponto de vista a partir do qual se conclui a análise. A fundamentação teórica da pesquisa tem sua base nos estudos franceses sobre cultura escolar e história das disciplinas escolares desenvolvidos nas últimas décadas por autores como Jean Hébrard, Anne-Marie Chartier e André Chervel. Para o estudo da escola e livro didático brasileiros foram referências centrais trabalhos de Circe Bittencourt, Luciano Mendes de Faria Filho, Antonio Augusto Gomes Batista e Diana Gonçalves Vidal. Sobre o ensino de retórica a leitura se ancora em estudos de Roberto Acízelo de Souza, João Adolfo Hansen, José Maria Paiva e Walter Ong. Sobre gênero e tipologia textual referências centrais vêm de Mikhail Bakhtin, Schneuwly e Dolz, Jean-Michel Adam, Guiomar Ciapuscio e Helena Nagamine Brandão.||This study is a result of a historical research about the teaching of composition in the Brazilian school. The work focuses a school textbook published in Rio de Janeiro in 1883, Manual de estilo, by V. Sá de Menezes. Written to help students in the process of writing, this book is a synthesis of the content presented in Rhetoric textbooks that were used in schools at the end of the 19.th century. Then, in the intention to understand part of the Rhetoric tradition that Manual de Estilo dialogues with, we begin this thesis discussing Ratio studiorum, the Jesuit school's pedagogic method. The goal was to identify different writing types of exercises proposed by the humanistic model of education followed by this religious segment. The choice for the Jesuits came from their importance at the Brazilian educational process during the period from XVI to XVIII century. From the second half of the XVIII century, we selected the orientation of writing education found in Verdadeiro método de estudar, by Luis Antonio Verney, and in Instrucções para os Professores de Grammatica latina Grega, Hebraica, e de Rethorica... announced by the Portuguese government in 1759. In the chapter 2, when we reach the XIX century, we present information about how the elementary e secondary schools were being organized, in order to connect the Manual de estylo to its reality of existence. The analysis of the content of Manual de estylo is developed between the chapter 3 and 4, when we discuss the presence of a conception of language as thinking expression and the repercussions of this understanding to the types of teaching proposed in this book and other textbooks from the end of XIX century and beginning of XX century. The typology ""narration, description and letter"" that we found as the core of the writing process proposed by Manual de estylo and contemporary books suggests us the hypothetical conclusion that the typology ""narration, description, dissertation"" might be an invention created in the XX century, what we discuss in the final chapter. This research is based on the French studies about the scholar culture and the history of the academic disciplines developed in past years by Jean Hébrard, Anne-Marie Chartier, André Chervel and others. For the study of the Brazilian school and Brazilian textbooks we have referred to Circe Bittencourt, Luciano Mendes de Faria Filho, Antonio Augusto Gomes Batista, Diana Gonçalves Vidal and others. About the teaching of Rhetoric we have based our observations on the study of Roberto Azícelo de Souza, João Adolfo Hansen, José Maria Paiva and Walter Ong.",,,Portuguese,REVIEW

Through an examination of the first documented musical contact between the Iroquois and the Jesuits in the 17th century, Chapter 2 addresses the question of when, under what conditions and for what reasons the Iroquois adopted European religious musical practices. Through the musical experiences as documented in the official reports of a residential school, Chapter 3 discusses the changing attitude of Canadian officialdom towards Native people and the impact these changing attitudes may have had on the acquisition of hymns by Six Nations. It examines the way that Native people were perceived as indicative of the ""Indian problem,"" why government and residential school officials chose the policy of assimilation, how music was implicit in the assimilation policy, what effects this policy had on the way in which Native people were exposed to Western music, and whether these effects were lasting and total. By looking more specifically at one hymn, ""The Lord's My Shepherd"" and how its story reveals both its history and the processes of adaptation, Chapter 4 presents the history, performance aesthetics, performance practices and social meanings in a contemporary performance of this hymn. Embedded in its musical fabric are a number of genealogical threads: Scottish words sung to an English melody, acquired by the Iroquois, translated into Mohawk and using a performance style bearing a non-Western aesthetic. This thesis is illustrative of how one comes to appreciate the music of other cultures, and what responsibility a listener has towards coming to an informed understanding of another culture's music: through becoming aware of its values, history and social practices.",,,English,REVIEW

Through a complex interaction of different imaginative functions, Loyola's text is able to superpose a variety of simultaneous narrative levels. In order to reformulate the ""greater narrative"" (the Magisterium) of the Roman faith beyond what is revealed in Scripture, the Spiritual Exercises require their exercitant to become an active participant in this narrative through constant visual contact with ""orders of corruption,"" that is, spaces in which virtue can be confronted with physical decay and sin. It is through these spaces that Counter-Reformation Rome (La Roma Ignaziana) will redefine the economy of salvation and diffuse the visual dynamics of the Spiritual Exercises throughout the Catholic world. Spanish Golden Age authors Miguel de Cervantes and Baltasar Gracian are well aware of this diffusion and use the rising Modernity of the novel to transform Loyola's notion of ""orders of corruption''; they adapt it to secular reality in their writings. Their encoded criticism of Loyolan imagination contributes to the epistemological crisis that marks the Baroque age, but also prepares the way for the crucial debates that will take place during the Enlightenment (such as the deconstruction of the Catholic ""greater narrative"" reflected in Loyola). This dissertation therefore concludes with a discussion of the eventual negation of Loyolan imagination in the novels of the marquis de Sade. As an ex-student of the Jesuits, Sade undermines the Roman faith by parodying the Baroque forms of spiritual visual experience and negates the Loyolan projection into ""orders of corruption.""",,,English,REVIEW

At the Pre-Colombian time, the Peabiru Trail used to be a native trail that passed through the South America, from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean, going through Paraná, Santa Catarina, São Paulo, Mato Grosso, Paraguay and Bolivia. It had an important role in the formation of the current Paraná territory, because it was used by adventurers, Jesuits, explorers and European settlers. Nowadays, it is rare to find vestiges, however there are cartographic and bibliographic documents that describe its localization and, based on them, the route of the trail was traced on the current Paraná territory. From that spatial localization of the Peabiru Trail, field researches have been carried out in regional level, in the North of COMCAM, to try to gather historic and cultural aspects of the region in order to create a georeferenced data base and SIG-PEABIRU TRAIL IN COMCAM as well.

Le régime en place est alors celui du gouvernement de Chiang Kai-shek et notre étude se propose d’explorer l’implantation des Jésuites sur l’île sous le régime de Chiang Kai-shek. La problématique s’organise principalement autour de deux thèmes. Le premier concerne le contexte dans lequel s’intègrent les Jésuites: quelle est l’influence sur la mission jésuite du contexte politique que connaît alors Taiwan? Comment les autorités tentent-elles d’exercer leur influence sur les Jésuites et l’Eglise taiwanaise? Quelles sont les caractéristiques des relations que tissent les Jésuites avec le pouvoir politique? La politique nationale suprême de la contre-offensive sur le continent et de l’anti-communisme a-t-elle un impact sur la mission jésuite? Quels sont les effets de l’idéologique politique du Guomindang sur l’action des Jésuites? Le deuxième thème est centré sur les initiatives mêmes des Jésuites: les démarches pour implanter l’Eglise, les raisons de leurs succès ou de leurs échecs, les obstacles rencontrés dans leurs missions et enfin, leurs rapports avec la société taiwanaise. Cette étude nous conduira à explorer la mutation que connaît l’entreprise missionnaire menée par les Jésuites, depuis son avènement jusqu’à son déclin. Le sujet est vaste mais notre ambition n’est pas de découvrir toutes les raisons expliquant l’essor et le déclin de la mission jésuite à Taiwan. Nous nous focaliserons sur celles relatives à l’action du gouvernement et au contexte social. L’essor économique que connaît Taiwan sous Chiang Kai-shek a une grande influence sur la vie de l’Eglise taiwanaise, de même que le changement de la vie familiale et des mentalités. Nous nous limiterons à l’étude des facteurs de changement ayant trait à la mission jésuite, tels que l’émigration des habitants et la mutation de la société à travers l’éducation et le travail. Nous porterons une attention particulière à la manière dont les Jésuites appréhendent la culture locale, pour adapter aux indigènes la doctrine catholique. Pour mieux comprendre les caractéristiques de la mission jésuite, nous chercherons notamment à montrer en quoi les Jésuites évoluent de l’“adaptation” à l’“inculturation”. Nous tenterons, à partir des notions d’inculturation et d’adaptation, d’analyser la rencontre entre la doctrine catholique présentée par les Jésuites et la vie du peuple taiwanais; nous montrerons également les réactions des Jésuites face aux problèmes rencontrés: la gestion des œuvres missionnaires, la pédagogie jésuite et l’approche du peuple en sont autant de facettes. La question de l’inculturation est centrale dans notre étude. Bien que la théorie de l’inculturation se constitue à partir des années 1980, notre étude s’enrichira à la lumière de cette théorie, y compris pour explorer les missions jésuites en Chine du temps de Matteo Ricci et également pour analyser l’action jésuite à Taiwan dans la deuxième moitié du XXe siècle. Afin de mieux comprendre les caractéristiques des missions jésuites à Taiwan, nous insisterons en premier lieu, dans la structure de notre étude, sur l’origine des Jésuites de Taiwan, leurs rapports avec les autorités ecclésiales taiwanaises, avec le gouvernement taiwanais et avec la Curie Généralice de Rome. En se confrontant aux éléments culturels du contexte social taiwanais, les Jésuites subissent l’influence des autorités religieuses et politiques qui est a fortiori importante et directe. En deuxième lieu, pour observer l’impact du gouvernement nationaliste sur l’action des Jésuites, nous analyserons trois facettes de l’exercice de son pouvoir: les règlements juridiques, le Service de renseignements et les mouvements culturels. De façon plus précise, notre étude poursuit sept objectifs: 1) Présenter le contexte que rencontrent les Jésuites dans leur mission tant dans la pastorale que dans l’évangélisation, et les réactions qu’elles génèrent. 2) Explorer le rôle du gouvernement taiwanais et l’influence de son idéologie politique sur l’inculturation de la mission jésuite. 3) Découvrir les éléments liés à l’action du gouvernement qui entravent la mission. 4) Mettre en évidence le rôle et l’action de l’épiscopat dans la mission jésuite. 5) Analyser l’attitude des croyants et des non croyants envers la mission jésuite. 6) Etudier les solutions des Jésuites face aux problèmes de leur mission, et les conséquences qui en découlent. 7) Montrer l’évolution de l’adaptation de la mission jésuite et soulever le problème de l’inculturation. Avec la priorité nationale de la sinisation, la ligne de conduite adoptée par les Jésuites et les clercs chinois coïncide en partie avec celle impulsée par les autorités nationalistes. Cette étude s’intéresse aux impacts de l’idéologie politique sur le processus continu de l’adaptation théologique et liturgique poursuivie par les Jésuites. Nous tenterons de savoir si l’inculturation théologique menée par les Jésuites s’harmonise avec les réalités locales et correspond aux attentes des Taiwanais.| |We can precise the date of the beginning of the Jesuit mission in Taiwan with the arrival of Paul O’Brien in September 1951. The regime was then the government of Chiang Kai-shek. Our studies propose is to explore the Jesuits’ implantation on this island under the regime of Chiang Kai-shek. The problematical issue is principally organized around two themes. The first concerns the context in which the Jesuits were integrated: what kind of influence was exercised on their mission in this political context? How did the authorities exercise their influence on the Jesuits and the Taiwanese Church? What were the characteristics of the relationship that weaved the Jesuits with the political authority? Did the supreme national policy of the counter-attack on the continent and the anti-communism have an impact on the Jesuit mission? Which were the effects of the Guomindang’s ideological policy on the Jesuit’s action? The second theme is centered on the Jesuits’ initiatives: the approaches for implanting the Church, the reasons of their success or of their failure, the obstacles met in their missions and their contributions to the Taiwanese society. This study allows us to explore the mutation of the Jesuits’ missionary action, from its very begin to its decline. The subject is vast but our ambition is by no means to discover all the reasons explaining the rapid expansion and the decline of the Jesuits’ mission in Taiwan. Our focus spots on the reasons relating the government’s action and the social context. The economic rapid development during the Chiang’s government had an important influence on the Church, as well as on the change of the familial life and the mentality. We limit our issue in the study of the factors of changes concerning the Jesuits’ mission, just like the inhabitants’ emigration and the mutation of the society through education and employment. We pay a particular attention on the way of which the Jesuits apprehend the local culture, for adapting to the local people the Catholicism. In order to understand better the characteristics of Jesuits’ mission, we try to demonstrate how the Jesuits evolve their action from the “adaptation” to the “inculturation”. Basing on the notions of inculturation and of adaptation, we attempt to analyze the encounter between the catholic doctrine presented by the Jesuits and the Taiwanese people’s life; their reactions regarding to the problems will be studied: the management of missionary works and the ways of approaching the people are of these fields. The issue of inculturation is essential in our study. Even though the theory of the inculturation forms since the 1980’s, our study gets enriched in the light of this theory, including for exploring the Jesuits’ missions in China in the time of Matteo Ricci and equally for analyzing the Jesuits’ action in Taiwan in the 20th century. In order to understand better the characteristics of the Jesuits’ missions in Taiwan, first of all, we start from their origin of these missions, their relationship with the ecclesial authorities, with the Taiwanese government and the Jesuits’ leadership in Rome. Integrated in the Taiwanese social context, the Jesuits were subjected to the influence of the religious and political authorities that was a fortiori important and direct. Secondly, we attempt to analyze the impact of the nationalist government on the Jesuits’ action through three aspects of its political power: the juridical regulations, the intelligence network and the cultural movements.",(Lyon),,French,REVIEW

Thinking highly of knowledge is also the important cultural aspect of the western civilization. Not only the Macartney embassy in 1793 is a good case for researching this kind of phenomenon, but also an alternative new perspective to reconsider the Chinese modern history. Compared with the western embassy before, the Macartney embassy possessed the character of scientific investigation team and the specific characteristic of intentionally showing the English civilization (technology and industry) in the character of present as well. The embassy purposely brought quite a few advanced instruments and weapons as presents, including the newest industrial manufactures, mechanical models and scientific instruments and so on (the total sum is 29). There are even novel technological devices, such as hot balloon and diving bell, in order to manifest the priority of its material civilization. However, the main purpose of displaying presents is not for transmitting scientific gospel, so blaming the emperor Qiang-long for not grasping the opportunity of modernization, so called modernization discourse, is not reasonable. Collecting all kinds of Chinese technical information, such as paktong, nankeen, and tea-producing, by means of scientific investigation, the embassy had certain impacted on the lost of the world market advantage of the Chinese manufactures afterwards. Besides the embassys observation on every aspects of the Chinese society is apparently different from the Chinese image provided by the Jesuits, so it recast and rewrote the good impressions and fancies of western society on Chinese and ended the chinoiserie of the west at last. Although the embassy failed to achieve the goal of the diplomatic mission, they brought the new viewpoint of China to the west: from The Middle Kingdom to The Muddle Kingdom, which its entire civilization lapsed into the state",,,Chinese,REVIEW

Revising existing interpretations, it argues that both clerical and lay Catholics, chief among them the printer Mathew Carey, carefully negotiated the first Catholic presence in the public sphere through the medium of print. This early Catholic culture appropriated ""enlightened"" rhetoric and modes of expression in order to critique the anti-Catholic legacy of the Colonial period that viewed Catholicism as a remnant of the ""Dark Ages"" and incompatible with republicanism. I argue that this pervasive historical view of Catholicism as anti-progressive is key to understanding the persistence of anti-Catholicism in the history-conscious early republic. Catholics of this era strove to define the public face of the Church in America as sympathetic to the dominant values of the founding generation, and to dispute Whig historical views of Catholicism's role in history, especially the history of England and then Britain. In this era, I argue, anti-Catholicism can be viewed as primarily ideological in nature.; Mathew Carey's brand of republican Catholicism brought from Ireland in the 1780s provided an existing model for this experiment, and like-minded American-born Catholics such as first bishop John Carroll also attempted to carefully control perceptions of the new church as ""foreign."" This was achieved through printed statements addressed to American Catholics, to President Washington, in responses to renegade or outspoken Catholic clergy, through Catholic devotional and instructional publications, the printing and marketing of the first Douai Bible in America, critiques of Whig history, and in Carey's participation in an extended newspaper controversy sparked by a derogatory reference to Catholic doctrine made by a politician.; By the time of Carey's death in 1839, this experiment in enlightened, republican Catholicism ended, as the Church, facing renewed anti-Catholicism that arose in reaction to massive ethnic Catholic immigration, ghettoized itself into an enclosed sub-culture increasingly viewed as dominated by ""foreign"" clerical leadership.",,,English,REVIEW

I went to the library of|the Jesuit Historical Institute (Rome) to begin my research for a dissertation topic, initially concerning the composer Marc-Antoine Charpentier, an employee of the Jesuits in Paris in the eighteenth century. Looking through the indices of Archivum Historicum Societatis Iesu, the journal of the Jesuits’ Historical Institute in Rome, I came upon an article contained in a bound volume of journals entitled “Musical Activity in the Church of the Gesu in Rome during the Early Baroque” by Graham Dixon. While reading the article, I quickly found a reference in one of the footnotes that piqued my interest. This reference began with a four-letter prefix that I did not know. It read “ARSI Chiesa del Gesu, libro 2007, Or dine et Osservationi della nostra Chiesa per tutto L’Anno.” Though I immediately recognized the reference to the Church of the Gesu, the four upper-case|letters confused me.

I filled out the holdings request form, and, within minutes, I held the document in my hand. To my surprise, it was written in Italian, rather than Latin. I wondered how many details it might provide to answer the question of the Jesuits’ early use of liturgical music. During the remainder of the week I searched further, looking through seemingly endless boxes of original musical manuscripts from the seventeenth century, interesting potentials for other projects in the future. Particularly in light of the belief of some that the Jesuits were anti-musical and that Ignatius had turned his back on music, I began by looking for a primary source book or original project that was connected to music and the Jesuits. Through all the searching I found myself repeatedly coming back to CDG2007, a reference book of ceremonial instructions on the liturgical rituals performed at the Gesu. Drawn to these handwritten pages whose full content I could only begin to surmise, at the end of the week I ordered its contents be placed on CD-ROM.

They can be identified in seminal form with specific New Testament passages. The St. Stephen model shows the strength of Christian witness to lead others to Christ, and is based on the martyrdom of St. Stephen (Acts 7:54–-60). The Jerusalem model describes the evangelizing power of the sacred liturgy, and is discerned in the first Christian liturgical celebrations in Jerusalem (Acts 2:42–-47). The Petrine model points to the preaching of the Word, and has its origin in St. Peter's first sermon on the day of Pentecost (Acts 2:14–-41). The Apostolic model highlights the role of the small, fervent community in the propagation of the faith, and is founded on Jesus' selection and commissioning of the Twelve Apostles (Mk 3:13–-19). The Areopagus model involves the inculturation of Christianity in the fabric of society, and looks to St. Paul's address to the Athenians in the Areopagus as its prototype (Acts 17:16–-34). The Loaves and Fishes model calls attention to the evangelizing effects of Christian charity reflected in the corporal and spiritual works of mercy performed by His followers, and is typified in Jesus' healing and feeding the multitudes (Mt 15:29–-38). Each of these models of evangelization is readily observed in every age of Church history. In the American context, the St. Stephen model is illustrated in the courageous Jesuit witness before the native peoples of North America. The Jerusalem model was extensively employed by Junipero Serra and his fellow Franciscans as a primary means of introducing the California Indians to the mystery of Christ. The Petrine model is portrayed in the parish mission crusade that revived the immigrant Church in the nineteenth century. The Apostolic model is represented by the mission of Fr. Hecker and the Paulist Fathers, the first religious order of priests founded in America. The Areopagus model is evident in the life a ...",,,English,REVIEW
Dissertation,"Brust, Steven John",2006,The Origin and Nature of Political and Spiritual Power: Natural Rights and Natural Law in the Thought of Francisco Suarez,"Washington, DC",Catholic University of America,300,PhD diss.,,,,,16th century|17th century,Philosophy -- Law|Political Thought|Philosophy -- Scholasticism,,"Suárez, Francisco, 1548–1617","This dissertation concerns the political thought of the 16th century thinker Francisco Suarez. Among some political theorists and historians, there is a continuing debate surrounding the origins and nature of liberal democracy. Some place Suarez in a line of thought which has its foundations in the medieval jurists and later scholastic theologians and which is then developed by the more modern thinkers, such as Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau, while others see the modern thinkers as departing from Suarez. In addition, most commentators ignore or give little attention to key areas of his work pertaining to church/state relations and subjective natural rights and natural law---both of which are important factors in assessing his relationship to liberal democracy. Although Suarez writes of a ""state of nature,"" two ""social contracts,"" political power and popular sovereignty, and subjective natural rights and law, he has a specific qualified understanding of these notions which are rooted in his overall hierarchical view of God and nature, and the political and ecclesial powers and communities. Consequently, whatever he claims regarding the naturalness and ""independence"" and ""autonomy"" of the political order, he does not retreat from the supernatural and spiritual order. The connection between these two orders manifests itself most especially in the relation between the political power and the spiritual power of the Church under the rubric of the indirect power of the pope in temporal matters. Suarez distinguishes between the non-Christian king and kingdom and the Christian king and kingdom, resulting in two different relations between the two powers. Furthermore, Suarez does claim that there are subjective natural rights that have their ultimate foundation in the fact that man is made in the image of God, and is master of himself. These rights are understood in connection with man's social nature, whereby man lives in community with others in order that he might reach the end for which he was created. Laws are a primary means to lead man to this end. Thus, any natural rights that one possesses are always conditioned by these laws, especially the natural moral law which gives rights their purposeful direction.",,,English,REVIEW
Dissertation,"Brunk, Timothy M.",2006,A Critical Assessment of Sacrament and Ethics in the Thought of Louis-Marie Chauvet,"Milwaukee, WI",Marquette University,286,PhD diss.,,,http://epublications.marquette.edu/dissertations/AAI3210956,,20th century,Theology -- Sacraments|Theology -- Ethics|Biography -- Intellectual,,"Rahner, Karl, 1904–1984|Segundo, Juan Luis, 1925–1996|Sobrino, Jon, 1938–","In this dissertation, I make and defend the claim that Louis-Marie Chauvet has provided the best articulation yet on the relationship between sacramental worship and ethical practice outside of formal worship. It is widely observed that believers experience a disconnect between their lives of prayer and worship on the one hand and their workaday lives on the other. Drawing upon the work of philosopher Martin Heidegger, historian Georges Duby, and anthropologist Marcel Mauss, Chauvet constructs a model of Christian existence with sacramentality at its very core---a model which takes full account of the fruitful tension that exists between sacramental worship and daily life. I begin by examining past efforts to grasp the nature of the relationship between sacrament and ethics, including what Vatican Council II brings to the question. Theologians such as Karl Rahner, Edward Schillebeeckx, Bernard Häring, Juan Luis Segundo, Vigen Guroian, Don Saliers, and Virgil Michel all addressed this issue, but like the Council itself, none of these figures examined how sacramental ritual as ritual implicated participants in the living of an ethical life. Subsequent chapters investigate how Chauvet has used post-modern linguistic theory associated with Heidegger and the gift theory associated with Mauss in order to provide a framework for understanding how sacramental ritual inaugurates or re-inaugurates the Christian identity of those who participate in them and also how these rituals of their very nature involve a return-gift to God of loving praxis towards one's neighbors. Aspects of Chauvet's program have been challenged by Henry Mottu, Yves Labbé, Jean-Yves Quellec, Vincent Miller, and Daniel Franklin Pilario. These writers question Chauvet's appropriation of Heidegger and Chauvet's use of anthropological categories. I argue that Chauvet's thought can on the whole be vindicated against these critics. The dissertation concludes by placing Chauvet in dialogue with liberation theologians such as Jon Sobrino and with feminist theologians such as Susan Ross in order to examine how Chauvet's thought can be brought to bear on the concerns such thinkers bring to the table; I also analyze Sunday celebrations in the absence of a priest from the perspective of Chauvet's theology.",,,English,REVIEW

Le choix de ce thème a été motivé par le fait que pendant ces dernières années la confrontation avec le pluralisme culturel et religieux a conduit la théologie chrétienne à réfléchir de manière nouvelle sur cette question. Elle porte sur le christianisme en tant qu'il a pour spécificité de rendre témoignage à un homme confessé comme le Fils unique de Dieu et le Sauveur de tous les hommes. Dans ce sens, la finalité de notre recherche est de montrer la signification et la portée de l'affirmation de Jésus-Christ comme unique Médiateur de notre salut, et ce dans le cadre de la théologie fondamentale et en particulier de la christologie. Bien que cette doctrine ait été toujours et soit encore une pierre d'achoppement pour ceux qui ne partagent pas notre foi, elle représente pour la tradition chrétienne plus qu'une croyance centrale, elle est vue comme le fondement même de la foi. Pour montrer la pertinence du sujet traité, ainsi que les chemins à suivre afin de proposer de nouvelles perspectives pour la réflexion théologique, notre point de départ est l'analyse du phénomène de la multiplication des modèles interprétatifs concernant le rapport entre le christianisme et les autres religions. Les recherches menées par Peter Schineller, Joseph Gelot, Paul Knitter, Camil Ménard et Jacques Dupuis dans ce domaine, nous ont permis de nous familiariser avec le vocabulaire utilisé dans la discussion (exclusivisme, inclusivisme, pluralisme, etc.) et de percevoir les possibles relations entre les modèles proposés. Du point de vue de notre travail, ces analyses montrent d'une part que la question christologique se trouve au c?ur du débat, et d'autre part que l'enjeu de celui-ci se situe dans la manière dont les théologiens cités comme représentants de chaque modèle, chacun à partir de ses propres présupposés, traitent la question de l'unicité et de l'universalité du Christ. C'est cette double constatation qui nous a amené à choisir d'étudier la pensée de cinq théologiens contemporains: Karl Barth, Hans Urs von Balthasar, Edward Schillebeeckx, Karl Rahner et John Hick. La partie conclusive de la thèse expose les perspectives christologiques qui se dégagent de la recherche. Elle offre une esquisse élaborée avec la conviction que la christologie ne se limite pas à offrir un répertoire d'opinions sur le Christ, mais qu'elle est une réflexion dynamique et attentive aux défis qui lui sont adressés. Notre étude conduit, d'une part, à une prise de distance critique vis-à-vis des modèles ou catégories qui sont proposés aujourd'hui pour expliquer la pluralité d'opinions concernant l'unicité et l'universalité de Jésus-Christ.

La présente démarche vise à comprendre les appropriations de l’écrit, la pluralité de ses interprétations et de ses usages. A Lyon, au XVIIe siècle, période considérée comme celle de l’entrée dans l’écrit (accroissement de l’enregistrement et du contrôle, inflation paperassière, constitution d’archives par les institutions), quels sont les usages de l'écrit, de quels statuts symboliques est-il investi ? L’accès croissant des individus à l’écrit, qu’il faut analyser précisément (temps, lieux, logiques de la diffusion selon les formes écrites) induit des changements, que l’on peut suivre selon trois perspectives. Inscrit dans un lieu, l’écrit a d’abord des effets sur l’appréhension de l’espace, que ce soit l’espace graphique, l’espace de l’édifice où il est inséré, de l’objet qui le supporte, ou l’espace de la ville. Il transforme ensuite les modalités des échanges marchands en s’imposant dans les transactions économiques les plus courantes, qui contribuent à familiariser la population urbaine avec son maniement. Il est enfin au cœur de la constitution d’une culture, culture de groupe ou d’individu, et des phénomènes identitaires qui l’accompagnent. Ces trois axes privilégient chaque fois des formes écrites différentes, pour certaines ancrées dans des traditions bibliographiques, écrits exposés, papiers, livres et ego-documents, correspondant aux modalités de leur appréhension (exposition, circulation, conservation).||This thesis attempts to approach the relationships between an urban population and literacy at a time characterised by an increase of writings and a resort even more important to writings (development of scribal proofs in justice, ""bureaucratization"", constitution of public archives). The gap between the capacity of reading and writing (which concerns a few persons) and the writing forms' expansion is the key of our investigation. In the seventeenth century, in the big town of Lyon, there are many ways to measure the inflation of writings and to understand their appropriations. First, we try to see how epitaphs, house names, shop signs, permanent and temporary inscriptions are surrounding the city, how the institutions (and principally the Municipality) product rules and resort to literate men like Jesuits to mark their names on Lyon's walls and buildings and to catch the power of the urban signs and doing so, how they contribute to create a public sphere. Then, we examine the question of the usual writings, contracts, receipts, economic and judiciary documents, which the common population is compelled to deal with. The trials of thefts of papers and of false documents inform about the appearance of a scribal proof's economy. At least, we question the social and cultural identity's build-up by the possession of printed books and by the act of writing (""ego-documents"").",,,French,REVIEW

In other words, this research study proposed to provide a group of students with a space and opportunity for a 'calling to attend' experience of God; that is, an experience that was compelling. The theoretical framework called on two types of concepts: first, those related to the theological investigation of revelation and its connection with the aesthetic and religious experience; and secondly, those developed from current educational research and research into Religious Education paradigms. The development of this research study therefore: established the context within which the study was situated; discussed a theological framework from Hans Urs von Balthasar and its links with this research study; examined the theory of Bernard Lonergan that art was a carrier of meaning for religious experience; discussed the role of revelation, aesthetic and religious experience and the religious imagination located within the 'graced nature' concept of Catholic theology; and sought to determine the contribution such a learning experience could make to the religious development of post-compulsory students in a boys' senior secondary college. This study operated within a constructivist paradigm using case study and qualitative research methods.

F., 1904–1984","This work is grounded in a moral horizon constructed around the worldview of emergent probability as central to a generalized theory of evolution reaching finality in the Trinity, in Otto Friedman's transdisciplinary framework for professional practice transposed into the realm of the transcendent, in Bernard Lonergan's transdisciplinary method in Insight and Method , and in an analysis of core problems in contemporary society. All these elements, when used as a guide to an encounter with the incarnate meaning of Thomas Müntzer, make explicit the horizons and intentions of the author as they relate to different levels of conversion required for intelligent, reasonable and responsible action during times of fundamental institutional change. This study offers one concrete approach to objectifying such foundations, where the heuristic notion of an encounter with the meaning of another's life provides data for objectifying one's own foundations. This objectified intentionality can then be used to expand one's horizon and intentions or initiate a shift to a higher viewpoint. This work operates not at the level of common sense understanding but in the explanatory theoretical realm of meaning grounded in a working knowledge of the realm of interiority. My encounter partner is Thomas Müntzer, an early 16th century German reformer whose commitment to Church and God fills a grey area in my own scientific and policy-making background. Evaluating and extending my positions vis-Ã -vis Müntzer's foundations is the immediate task; knowing exactly how to do this is the general theme. The subject matter is neither MÃ¼ntzer nor the Reformation, although both are extensively researched, but my own foundational stance. The objective is not to work out a complete program, but to present and test one concrete procedure for intentionality analysis in the functional speciality of Foundations.",,,English,REVIEW

Although Baciccio's ceiling paintings for the church have been the subject of many scholarly publications, these frescoes only represent a small portion of the artist's extensive and diverse oeuvre. During his lifetime, Baciccio was best known as a portraitist, as he worked consistently in the genre throughout his artistic career, producing the likenesses of seven popes, numerous cardinals, and other figures of note. Celebrated for their ability to capture both the sitters' physical and psychological characteristics, Baciccio's portraits reveal a strong stylistic affinity with those of his mentor, Gian Lorenzo Bernini, which calls his perceived individuality as an artist into question. In this examination, it is held that Baciccio's professional relationship with Bernini allowed for many of the popular stylistic characteristics of Bernini's work, particularly those of his sculpted portraiture, to be imparted on the manner of the younger Genoese artist. It is also maintained that Baciccio's financial success undoubtedly hinged on his close affiliation with Bernini, who orchestrated numerous commissions for his protégé. In addition to the deft translation of his mentor's sculpted style into the medium of painting, Baciccio experimented with the styles of other successful artists, such as Rubens, Van Dyck, Rembrandt, Velázquez, Maratti, and Poussin, among others. The motives for the arguably deliberate emulation of these artists' styles are also weighed in the present study. It is ultimately determined that Baciccio's high productivity, willingness to execute works falling under the rubric of ""minor arts,"" demonstrable reuse of popular compositions, businesslike approach to producing preparatory sketches, and experimentation with different aesthetics, all support the notion that Baciccio intentionally cultivated a derivative artistic identity, which was likely fueled by an unwavering zeal for recognition and monetary success.",,,English,REVIEW

O objetivo é compreender como foi sendo construída esta disciplina, quais os fatores que influenciaram essa construção e, a partir deste estudo, num lócus específico, estabelecer relações com a construção social dessa disciplina no Brasil naquele período. A metodologia empregada foi a da pesquisa histórica, tendo como pressuposto a compreensão ampliada da noção de documento. As fontes analisadas foram livros didáticos e artigos escritos pelos padres/professores, relatórios do Ginásio, jornais de circulação da época, documentos oficiais, bem como foram realizadas entrevistas com ex-alunos que estudaram no Ginásio naquele período. A fundamentação teórica a partir da qual esta pesquisa foi estruturada baseia-se nos estudos sobre História das Disciplinas Escolares (HDE), especialmente nos trabalhos de Ivor Goodson. Algumas das contribuições desta pesquisa consistem em fazer emergir questões pouco exploradas na historiografia da Educação brasileira, como a mudança ocorrida na formação dos jesuítas no final do século XIX, a qual se refletiu na construção das disciplinas da área das Ciências Físicas e Biológicas no período anterior à década de cinqüenta do século XX, na região sul do Brasil. No entanto, a questão fundamental que perpassa todo este trabalho consiste na discussão sobre a relação entre os objetivos do ensino secundário propostos no currículo oficial e a pouca relevância social que caracterizava (ou ainda caracteriza) a disciplina escolar Química no currículo real do ensino secundário brasileiro.||The purpose in this research is to build the history of the school discipline chemistry in a secondary teaching institution, in the period 1909 to 1942. The search is to understand how this discipline was being constructed, which factors influenced this construction and, by the study in a specific locus, establish connections with the social construction of this discipline in Brazil, at that period. The methodology applied was historical research, having as purpose, the amplified comprehension of document notion. The sources analyzed were didactic books and articles written by priest/professors, Secondary school reports, newspapers from that period and official documents. Interviews were realized with ex-students who took Secondary education at that period in that School. The theoretical basis supporting this research was structured on the history of School Disciplines, especially on Ivor Goodsons works. Some of these contributions consisted in bringing into view questions not much explored in Brazilian education historiography, like the change in the Jesuits formation at the end of XIX century, which reflected on the construction of the disciplines of the area of Physics and Biology Sciences in the period before the decade of the 50 s in the XX century, in the South region of Brazil. However, the main question in this work consists in a discussion about the connection between the objectives of secondary education proposed in the formal curriculum and the small social relevance that characterized (or still characterizes) the Chemistry School discipline on the real curriculum of Brazilian Secondary education.",,,Portuguese,REVIEW

Les plus marquantes, soit l’anagramme et le jeux de mots, ne constituent pas, dans sa poétique, des artifices stylistiques mais bien des outils théologiques qui permettent au prêtre-poète d’élaborer une dialectique du Salut se fondant sur une opération permanente de caché/révélé au sein de chacun des poèmes de l’œuvre. Il réactive lors du processus les écrits des Pères de l’Église et des grandes figures de la pensée mystique tels Thomas à Kempis, Henri Suso ou Jacopone da Todi tout comme sont recyclés les genres littéraires profanes antérieurs et contemporains ou les expérimentations anagrammatiques de Cabalistes chrétiens comme Guy Le Fèvre de la Boderie ou Blaise de Vigenère. Dans le contexte de la nouvelle Querelle des Images l’auteur entend chasser l’image pieuse et le livre d’emblème de la sphère religieuse anglaise au profit du seul Verbe et du vernaculaire. Herbert s’adonne à un iconoclasme virtuel et s’ingénie à remplacer l’image per se par autant d’images mentales conformes au dogme et contribuant à l’émergence du lecteur moderne. Sa poétique s’oppose du même coup à la Contre-Réforme, Jésuite en particulier, et aura pour objectif majeur l’affirmation de la légitimité et de la suprématie de la jeune Église d’Angleterre.| |This research focuses on George Herbert’s frequent resorting to puns and anagrams in The Temple and his other works in prose and Latin. These are not to be viewed as mere tongue-in-cheek oddities but much rather as genuine literary as well as theological devices. This innovative stratagem opens on unexpectedly broad artistic scopes whilst serving a fully planned threefold religious strategy by disclosing additional layers of interpretation which are themselves profoundly embedded in dogma. The demonstration focuses on the poet’s rewriting of the Fathers of the Church’s literature and his recycling of earlier profane literary genres combined with frequent incursions in the works of Continental religious writers such as Thomas à Kempis, Henry Suso, Saint Teresa and Jacopone da Todi. This not only allowed the Bemerton priest/poet to compose a strong verbal attack on the Stuart monarchy but also to combat Jesuit propaganda and more specifically the then thriving emblem-book by imposing mental pictures, instead of actual ones, upon his potential readership, thus asserting the supremacy of the sole Word of God while promoting the full legitimacy of the then nascent Church of England.",,,French,REVIEW

The comparative story contrasts the programs of study offered by these Jesuit schools to those of their public school counterparts in Spokane and Seattle. Additionally, a brief analysis was conducted on the Jesuit schools’ perspectives and approaches to the civic purpose of schools, which for the purposes of this study was defined primarily by Patriotic and Americanizing paradigms.|The study explores the Jesuit high schools and their public school counterparts from 1887, marking the establishment of the first Jesuit high school in the state, to 1919. In addition to secondary sources, Archival materials were reviewed from the University of Washington, Seattle and Spokane Public Schools, and the Oregon Province. Materials included Programs of Study, Provincial and Presidents’ Papers, superintendent and Principals reports. The results of the study revealed that the Jesuit schools remained largely true to their liberal arts and humanistic roots, particularly as compared to the diverse offerings of their public school counterparts. This however was not absolute in that the courses of study at these Jesuit schools, with the addition of a Commercial Course, reflected an accommodative character as well. It was clear that both the Jesuit and public high schools were affected by the rapid population and economic growth of the region and developed curriculum consistent with the local demands.

However, the adequacy of the current understanding of the concept has not been subject to sufficient analysis. In order to address this deficiency, using the stem cell debate as a case study, I engage with the current understanding of freedom in a particular area of social activity. Examining the stem cell debate, I consider that freedom is defined in three ways; as the freedom of research, as the consent of gamete and embryo donors to create stem cells and as the freedom to transcend physical limitations. I argue that Isaiah Berlin’s categorization of freedom as negative and positive is useful in examining the understandings of freedom in the stem cell debate. I conclude that all of the currently accepted understandings of freedom in the stem cell debate tend to be focused on the individual and I argue that they are consequently problematic, resulting in individualism, conflict, subjectivism and inappropriate attitudes toward natural resources. In response to the problems identified, in the second part of the thesis I draw on the theology of Hans Urs von Balthasar in order to offer an alternative conception of freedom. Von Balthasar argues that although freedom entails individual willing and choosing, it also is relational, involving interaction with other people and God, both in the realisation of the possession of freedom and in the fulfilment of that freedom. Thus I argue that von Balthasar’s theology provides an effective counter to the neglect of relationships in the contemporary understanding of freedom. However von Balthasar, in his analysis, focuses on interpersonal relationships and he can be criticised for underplaying the role of society. I therefore expand upon his work employing the concept of the common good. This provides a means of examining freedom in the context of wider society. The conception of freedom thus arrived at is then considered in relation to the original case study of the stem cell debate. In doing this I provide a more nuanced rendering of the issues involved; one that is better able to accommodate the social and personal aspects.",,,English,REVIEW

While abundant previous material exists on presidential leadership, there is scarce information on the influence of the Jesuit leadership philosophies of a Jesuit university president or on the experiences of a Jesuit president maneuvering through the university's strategic planning process and implementation. The formative novitiate experience of the Spiritual Exercises has a pivotal impact on the development of Jesuit priests. This impact of the four pillars of Jesuit leadership, self-awareness, ingenuity, love, and heroism, were expected to heavily influence how the President of Jesuit Pacific University created, explained, and maintained his vision throughout the strategic planning process and implementation. This case study is bound by the university's strategic planning process and implementation and focuses on the president's perspective of inspiring and maintaining a shared vision, the roles he undertook to ensure the vision was understood and accepted, and how he overcame obstacles impacting the strategic plan. Particular attention is given to the cultural impact when creating change and the need for multiple opportunities for broad reflection during the implementation phase. A community may fully embrace a new vision, yet the emotional cost of not considering the community's initial image of itself when implementing it, not providing adequate time to process the changes in meaningful ways, and underestimating the difficulty of a cultural shift may result in resistance and criticism to the change initiative.",,,English,KEEP

However the intolerance was became inciting, the stigmas against the Jews reached every time more intensely the new christians Jesuits. The leaders of the Company tryed to give continuity to the tolerance legacy of the first generations of ignacians. But they gad soon adopted the anti-semitics practices. The Company of Jesus decided to adopt the Statute of Cleannses of Blood that obstructed the ingression of the converts. It was locked the humanistic stage of the ignatians, and it was closed the door of the house that received and allowed that many new Christians were part of the roll of the notorious Jesuits.",,,Portuguese,REVIEW

Today, that means expertise in math, technology and the sciences. In math, this requires access to and success in Calculus. Kaput (1997) and McNeil (2004), though, have described calculus as a gatehouse class which historically has limited access to higher fields. Research by Triesman (1986), Johnson and Johnson (1989), and others indicated that cooperative learning might help solve this problem. There are three interrelated problems with using cooperative learning as a solution to calculus-access in a Jesuit college preparatory school. First, cooperative learning, when not implemented properly, can lead to freeloading, which, in turn, can lead to resentment on the part of the harder-working and more capable student. Second, the amount of research that pertains to cooperative learning in pre-calculus is limited and none is in an Ignatian context. Finally, cooperative learning is student centered where Ignatian pedagogy and cura personalis are centered on the relationship between the individual student and teacher. In this study, 110 pre-calculus at a coeducational Jesuit college preparatory in California responded to 60 Likert-type statements about attitudes toward their peers, teachers, cooperative learning, and Ignatian education. Over a three-month period, half learned in a cooperative setting and half in a traditional setting. At the end of that time, they re-responded to the statements and rated themselves and each other as to how much freeloading occurred. An achievement test on knowledge acquisition of introductory Calculus topics was also administered. There was no significant difference between the control and treatment groups on achievement, and there were no significant differences between most pretest and posttest attitudes. The subjects' attitudes toward their teachers did not change nor did their attitudes toward cooperation or competition. However, the treatment group's preference for individual learning did grow stronger, freeloading did occur, and the posttest showed a significant decline in the sense of personal and academic support from peers.",,,English,KEEP

Jesuit universities in the United States are seeking to provide professional development opportunities for faculty and staff members that will effectively communicate the Jesuit Catholic educational mission, and that will cultivate new institutional leaders able to advance the university mission in the classroom and in the full range of university programs and activities. While it is a significant challenge to pass on the Jesuit spiritual heritage and educational tradition to a religiously and philosophically diverse population of faculty and staff members, it is a priority at a time of declining numbers of Jesuit faculty and staff members at Jesuit universities. This qualitative pilot case study sought to understand how the Nicaragua Immersion Experience at Seattle University had an impact on faculty and staff participant understanding of the Jesuit educational mission, particularly the elements of education for justice and education for global engagement. The study examined the program components which had an influence on participants and considered the expression of impact through participant attitudes and behaviors. Individual interviews were held with a purposeful sample of 15 past participants, ten faculty members and five administrators, among whom were 8 men and 7 women, selected from a pool of 80 past participants currently employed at Seattle University in June, 2007. Interviewees represented all seven program years, and reflected a wide range of disciplines, program areas and years of university service. The findings showed an impact for faculty and staff participants through a deeper and more integrated understanding of the Jesuit mission. Influential program components included intimate and humanizing encounters with the poor, the collegial experience and engagement with the Jesuit university in Managua, the Universidad Centroamericana. Behavioral impact was expressed through a range of curricular, research and program activities. Attitudinal impact was expressed through greater appreciation of university commitment to mission, deepening of faith experience for some participants, and through a range of emotions prompting new perspectives on previously held ideas.",,,English,KEEP

Die Weltreligionen bemühen sich im Zusammenhang von unterschiedlichen soziokulturellen Realitäten um eine bedeutungsvolle Antwort auf die menschliche Frage nach Gott. In der ganzen religiösen Geschichte der Menschheit waren und sind sich die Menschen der verborgenen Kraft des Göttlichen bewusst, welche die Menschheitsgeschichte beinflusst. Die Gläubigen der verschiedenen Religionen sind gemeinsam auf der Suche nach eben diesem Göttlichen. Die Weltreligionen sind verschiedenartig, sie reflektieren seit vielen Generationen das Streben der Menschen nach Gott, den Wunsch nach einer Beziehung mit Gott. Die Religionen, die im Kontext der unterschiedlichen soziokulturellen Wirklichkeiten existierten, haben sich bemüht, sinnvolle Antworten auf die Sehnsucht der Menschheit nach Gott zu artikulieren. Die christliche Theologie der Religionen fragt nach der theologischen Bedeutung des religiösen Pluralismus und versucht die universale religiöse Erfahrung der Menschheit im Licht des christlichen Glaubens zu interpretieren. Sie fragt: Wie können Christen im Kontext und angesichts anderer Religionen ihren eigenen Glauben neu verstehen, bekennen und leben, wie können sie aus ihrem Glauben heraus die anderen Religionen verstehen und ihnen angemessen begegnen? Wie ist die religiöse Vielfalt theologisch zu deuten? Ist die Pluralität der Religionen nur ein lästiges, zu überwindendes Übel, oder etwas positiv zu Würdigendes, das möglicherweise seinen Platz in dem einen großen Heilsplan Gottes für die Menschheit hat? Hat Gott möglicherweise mit der Vielfalt der Religionen, die nicht zu verschwinden scheint, etwas vor? Und was würde dies für das Selbstverständnis der Christen, der Kirche, für ihren Verkündigungs- und Missionsauftrag bedeuten? Ferner soll die christliche Theologie der Religionen mit der Tatsache vertraut machen, dass eine bleibende Vielfalt der Religionen existiert und andere Religionen ihrerseits universale Wahrheitsansprüche erheben. Dieser Gegebenheit muss sich die Theologie stellen und sie in einem Ansatz christlicher Religionstheologie berücksichtigen.||Dupuis considers that God alone is absolute and not the religions. God, who shows no partiality, reveals himself to all his creatures, transcending the boundaries set by human concepts, categories and structures. He appreciates the richness and variety of the gifts poured out on the humankind in a Trinitarian rhythm, in and through the various religious traditions that have helped people to seek God and find him. Hence he asks, ""Is not God perhaps greater than our hearts"" (1Jn 3:20) ""and his plan of salvation larger than our theological ideas?"" The universal plan of God for the salvation of all humankind is the one and the same for all humankind. Hence, God has envisioned religious pluralism in his sole design for the salvation of all humankind. Jesus Christ is the unique universal mediator in God's economy of salvation. Salvation occurs in the universal presence and operation of the Holy Spirit without being confused or separated from the salvific mediation of Christ. The Church, being the universal sacrament and the fullness of God's gift of salvation, the whole economy of salvation is oriented and ordained to it. While the Reign of God is the manifestation and the realization of God's plan of salvation in all its fullness, the Church is the universal sacrament of God's gift of salvation for all humankind; and so it is at the service of the Reign of God. The religious others, along with their religions, find their unity in the Reign of God. Their religions, thus, participate in the unique mediation of Christ, by the universal presence operation of the Spirit in them. The Spirit works in them toward the actualisation of the plan of salvation and helps them for their convergence in the Reign of God. The eschatological fullness of the Reign of God is the common final achievement of Christianity and the other religions.",,,English,REVIEW

Sua configuração atual resulta do processo de expansão colonial ibérica e das relações que se estabeleceram entre os colonizadores e os habitantes locais e, entre ambos e o ambiente com seus recursos. Constatou-se que sua singularidade é uma conseqüência dos processos históricos que são evidenciados em três períodos bem característicos: Período pré-jesuítico: caracterizado pela organização dos Guarani em pequenas comunidades, que ocupavam os lugares com solo fértil para a prática da agricultura, como as várzeas dos grandes rios, vales e lugares com matas. Mantinham uma relação ecológica com o território, retirando da terra somente o necessário à sua sobrevivência. Período jesuítico: no qual houve a ?redução? da comunidade indígena, que passou a manter uma nova forma de se relacionar com o território; implantando, ao mesmo tempo, um sistema de produção coletivo-complementar, aliado a um sistema comercial responsável por enviar, para a Europa, produtos como sebo, erva-mate, algodão, chifre e couro. Período pós-jesuítico: vai, desde a derrocada das Missões até os dias de hoje. Caracterizado pelos desajustes sociais, econômicos e ambientais, frutos das expansões agropecuárias, mineiras e industrial, baseada em um modelo que se caracterizou pelo deterioramento do meio ambiente como custo necessário ao progresso, não se mostrou viável para resolver os problemas econômicos e sociais da população regional. Esse período caracteriza-se também pela busca de soluções para os problemas regionais, através da dinamização do uso público do rico patrimônio histórico-cultural através do turismo. Surgem projetos e programas voltados para a dinamização do turismo regional, no entanto os mesmos não atingiram totalmente os objetivos a que se propuseram. O uso do método evolutivo histórico, a partir da pesquisa bibliográfica e da pesquisa de campo, com observação direta sistematizada e realização de entrevistas, proporcionou o alcance dos objetivos de: analisar a importância das Missões Jesuíticas na consolidação das fronteiras do sul do Brasil; analisar a situação dos sítios arqueológicos das antigas reduções jesuítico-Guarani, avaliar a importância dos remanescentes arquitetônicos das reduções como potencial turístico; analisar os programas e projetos propostos para a Região das Missões em relação ao turismo, além de fornecer subsídios que possam contribuir para a implementação, intensificação e expansão da atividade turística regional.||The present work is a descriptive explanation of the processes of the occupation of the Jesuit-Guarani Missions, which ended up transforming it into a tourist atiraction beyond borders. Its present-day status is a result of the relations which have been established between the Iberian sett and the Local inhabitants and among themselves, and the environment with its resources. It can be said that its singularity is a consequence of the history´s processes which are evident in three welI-defined periods: Pre-Jesuit period it is characterized by the organization of the Guarani Indians in small communities which occupied places having a fertile soil, good for agriculture, like the flat lands along rivers, valleys and woodland. They maintained an ecological relation with lhe territory, extracting from the soil only the every day necessities for their survival. Jesuit Period: in which there was a ""reduction"" of the Indian community and which started a new way of interaction with the territory, irnplementing, at the same time, a coilective cornplementary production system together with a business-like system responsible for sending to Europe products like tallow, mate, cotton, horn and leather. Post-Jesuit Period: beginn ing since the destruction of the Missions till nowadays. lt is characterized by social , economical and environmental due to agronornic , mineral and industrial expansion, based on a model which is characterized by the deterioration of the environment as a by-product of progress, not being able to solve the economic and social problems of the regional population. This period is also characterized because of a search for solutions for regional problems, through a dynarnic use of its rich cultural-historical touristic patrirnony. The use of lhe historical evolutionary rnethod, through bibliographic and field research, with direct and systematic observation and interviews Ied to the following objectives: to analyze the irnportance of lhe Jesuit Missions in the consolidation of the Southern Brazilian boundaries; to analyze the situation of the archeological sites of the former Jesuit-Guarani reductions, to evaluate the importance of lhe architectonic remainings of the old Jesuit-Guarani reductions as a touristic potential; tlo analyze the prograrns and the projects destined to the Missions Region as far as tourism is concerned, besides best subsidies which can contribute in the implementation, intensification and expansion of lhe regional tourism activity.",,,Portuguese,REVIEW

Spiritual seekers have turned to his masterpiece The Spiritual Exercises to reflect on how they have encountered God in their own experience and especially to practice discernment. At the same time the religious order founded by Ignatius, the Society of Jesus, has been faced with a numerical decline and a desire to share their spiritual heritage with the larger “Ignatian Family.""|These dynamics have been powerfully expressed in Jesuit secondary schools. Beginning in the 1970s, the Jesuits began to reflect on how their schools could better embody Ignatian Spirituality as well as the mission of the Society to “heal souls” and to strive for justice. During this period Jesuit schools have developed principles, organizations and documents designed to deepen the schools from simply outstanding academic institutions into places that form “men and women for and with others.”|Does Ignatian Spirituality make any difference in the day to day work of Jesuit schools? After examining the main principles of Ignatian Spirituality and Jesuit pedagogy, this paper will investigate two Jesuit secondary schools to determine if these lofty principles truly shape the lives and work of administrators, students and faculty.

F., 1904–1984|Doran, Robert M., 1939–","This dissertation examines the ongoing conversion of a Christian as presented in the writings of Hans Urs von Balthasar. The analysis of Balthasar's thought is prefaced by an historical survey of conversion through the writings of St. Augustine of Hippo, St. Thomas Aquinas, OP and Bernard Lonergan, SJ. Following this historical contextualization, conversion is examined from three perspectives: (1) As a single essential form which may be manifest in a variety of ways because it is necessarily an individualized process. (2) As an individual dramatic aspect within the larger drama of redemption. (3) As a dialogue between God and the human being.|Under each of these three larger motifs, I analyze the role of each of the divine persons, (because conversion is always an act of the entire Trinity), the role of the human being (particularly with respect to freedom), the essential role of the Church, and the Marian dimension.|A final section addresses the significance of his conversion theory for the new evangelization as presented in the Encyclical, ""Ecclesiam Suam "" and continually revisited by Popes John Paul II and Benedict XVI. Both the current and former popes were close friends of Balthasar and shared a similar desire for a renewed evangelization. All three men shared a concern that Christianity had lost its vibrancy in the modern world and were concerned to bring the light of Christ and tradition back into the dialogue with modern thought.",,,English,REVIEW

Nonetheless, debate is ongoing over the integration, ordering and the substantive separation of these stages. An upshot of these debates is that each stage is loosely allied to a particular socio/political structure: hunter/gatherer or tribal societies, nation states, and globalisation respectively. In the current alloying of electronic communication and globalisation though there is a rising interest in what is termed new regionalism, or regionalisation, even regionality. Accordingly, Chora-Logic: Electracy as Regional Epistemology examines the possibility of an emerging conceptual alliance (and through reference to two Australian regions a sometimes embodied and situated one) between the embryonic communicational infrastructure of electracy and the age-old spatial scale of the region, a relationship that might just come to represent a means of rethinking the civic and the psychic, the commercial and governmental frameworks of an electro-energised global skein. It may also be a way of reinvigorating a study in the relation of the body (in its capacity as a citizen-subject) to the nation state, especially as all these entities are increasingly though ambiguously constituted in and through globalisation. The method of synthesising and antagonising these relations between electracy and regionalism is through the philosophy of chora, Platos conception of embodied place as found in the middle section of the Timaeus, coaxed along by a range of interpretations of this important genesis myth in Western philosophy. In particular, chora is taken up in the work of Gregory Ulmer as a key method in the ongoing conceptualisation of an electrate epistemology. Arising out of these concerns Chora-Logic is an experimental re-configuration of the sovereign, abstracted and disembodied citizen-subject of the Cartesian mould (a significant psycho-political mooring of the literate national character) to one situated both in the virtual density and multidimensional actuality of a particular place (organically conceived of herein as an idiosyncratic mix of psychic, domestic, workplace, local and regional proximities), but whose both dis embodied self-knowledge and world-knowledge are now increasingly realised by access to an electronically arbitrated global/regional polis. In sound-bite terms, the bumper sticker could just as easily proclaim the following inversion: Think and feel chora-logically, act globally. Finally, the nucleus of Chora-Logic: Electracy as Regional Epistemology is a risky praxis whose experimental eddy (in both formal and content terms) spins within the current ambivalence, uncertainty and fast-paced change in electronic communicative arrangements (electracy), as these are themselves wrapped in the psychic and socio-political variabilities of spatial affiliation, all of which are symbiotically entwined regardless of the historical period and/or the geographical context.",,,English,REVIEW

Yet, in its revolutionary project, the CCP did not want simply to consolidate power, it wanted to form subjects loyal to the state alone. In achieving such deep state penetration, the CCP brought to heel all groups that stood in its way. One such group deemed ""counterrevolutionary"" was the Shanghai Catholic community. The CCP were threatened by the independent organizational capacity of the Catholic Church. Catholics, for their part, were fighting for their very survival. Time would show that the CCP wanted nothing less than to dismantle the Catholic Church in Shanghai and replace it with a puppet church which answered only to the atheistic regime. Even despite mounting state pressure, the Shanghai Catholic Church resisted the CCP for over six years. How were they able to succeed where so many other groups failed? It is my contention that the Catholic community in Shanghai was able to mount a protracted and powerful campaign of resistance to encroaching Communist power because it had a unifying belief system, a strong leadership, and a well-articulated organization . Why Catholics resisted can be explained by Catholic belief. How Catholics resisted can be answered by Catholic leadership and organization. First, the Catholic community in Shanghai had a formidable leader in Bishop Kung (Gong) Pinmei. Kung valiantly resisted CCP to head an ""Independent Catholic Church,"" a contradiction in terms. The second key to Catholic success was a well-articulated organization. For Catholic leaders mobilized the laity, especially the youth. The resulting ""Catholic Youth"" organization drew from lay movements such as the Legion of Mary and the Jesuit-inspired Marian Sodalities. The ""Catholic Youth"" ensured that the faith would be passed on should the priests be arrested. Even according to ""secret"" internal CCP documents, Jesuit priests and the ""Catholic Youth"" formed the backbone of resistance to the Shanghai CCP. Thus, Catholic beliefs, a strong leadership, and a well-articulated organization coalesced to form a bulwark against encroaching state power.",,,English,REVIEW

The history of Alaskan Christian missions is unique: Alaska developed as an arbitrary cultural/geographical construct and also one of the few regions where representatives of all three main historical branches of Christianity - Catholic, Orthodox, and Protestant - proselytized simultaneously. Alaska is viewed as a special landscape where dynamic cross-cultural interactions and multi-denominational -in the case of Protestant - missionary ventures took place. Fierce competition characterized the regional cultural exchange at some times, reciprocity and friendly contacts at others. Those involved were the priests of the Russian Orthodox Church, Jesuit missionaries, Presbyterian, Episcopalian and Moravian preachers - men and women - as well as representatives of the Russian American Company, the Hudson's Bay Company's entrepreneurs and American fur traders. In this geographically remote and environmentally severe region, the Native populations - the Aleuts and Athapaskans, Tlingits and Haidas, Tsimsheans and Inuits -played an independent and crucial role in cross-cultural conversation. They were active participants in a complex process in which different sides had to alter their cultural attitudes, religious traditions, and ideological values in continuous interaction with each other. Thus, eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Alaska was a place where the existing religious and cultural identities of Natives and colonists dynamically interacted in a process of mutual transformation.",,,English,REVIEW

In the theology of Balthasar, Christian prayer is considered to be a participation in intra-trinitarian dialogue (prayer) and Christian vocation is a sharing in the intra-divine self-giving (mission). In the divine life, loving dialogue (prayer) and mutual self-giving between the Father and the Son in the Holy Spirit are one reality of love. Therefore in an authentic Christian life, which is a participation in divine life, prayer and vocation cannot be separated, but must also build a unity. For Balthasar prayer is a consequence of a previous vocation, and it could influence subsequent vocations. During prayer one has to be prepared to receive a call from God; therefore prayer is a vocational reality. In Balthasar's understanding of prayer, obedience to the calling and sending will of God is central. Obedience to one's vocation is the criterion of the genuineness of prayer. On the other hand, a vocation can be received and discerned only in the context of prayer; thus vocation needs prayer. The unity between prayer and vocation in everyday life can be illustrated by the mutually penetrating relationship of contemplation and action. Although Balthasar emphasizes this unity of prayer and vocation, he still maintains that prayer is not simply a function of personal vocation. Prayer life should also include an aspect of absolute gratuity, a certain ""pointlessness"" which can be described only with the terms of self-less love, which has its root in the Trinitarian life. The divine initiative of love fuses a dynamic unity of prayer and vocation, and this unity is essential for Christian life and ecclesial renewal. Balthasar's approach can deepen and challenge our contemporary theology of prayer and vocation, even our understanding of the meaning of human existence.",,,English,REVIEW

Dick, fear of entropy is the primary catalyst for action, and one way the characters endeavour to escape entropy is through human evolution. Evolution is thought both to counteract entropy and to enable spiritual transcendence to a more permanent universe where entropy cannot follow. This thesis traces the two kinds of evolution found in these novels, the ineffective kind and the effective kind. The first is technological and left-brained; it tends to lead in Dick not to evolution and transcendence but to capitalist oppression, loss of agency, loss of identity, eugenics, and a totalitarian police state, all of which lead instead to devolution and an increase in the entropy of the universe. The second kind of evolution is biological and right-brained, and it stems from human empathy. Empathy, in Dick's novels, as it grows stronger, becomes telepathy and eventually forms the beginnings of a collective consciousness very much like Pierre Teilhard de Chardin's notion of a noosphere. This collectivity of mankind is brought about by love and empathy and will enable the transcendence and escape from entropy that Dick's characters seek. This thesis uses historical, philosophical, and scientific contexts to clarify this binary in Dick's work between left-brained technological devolution and right-brained empathic evolution. At their most ambitious, these novels supply a model for how Dick believes the human race ought to proceed if it intends to survive: not through advanced technological posthumanism, but through the simple advancement and dissemination of love and empathy.",,,English,REVIEW

Books and articles abound on the Trinity and personhood, the Trinity and ecclesiology, the Trinity and gender, the Trinity and marriage, the Trinity and societal relations, the Trinity and politics, the Trinity and ecology, etc. Recently a number of theologians have suggested that a doctrine of the Trinity may provide the key to a Christian theology of religions. The purpose of this study is to evaluate critically the claim that a proper understanding of ""the Trinity"" provides the basis for a new understanding of religious diversity. |Drawing upon the trinitarian theology of Augustine (principally De Trinitate), I critically examine the trinitarian doctrine in Mark Heim's trinitarian theology of multiple religious ends, Amos Yong's pneumatological theology of religions, Jacques Dupuis' Christian theology of religious pluralism and Raimundo Panikkar's trinitarian account of religious experience (along with Ewert Cousins' efforts to link Panikkar's proposal to the vestige tradition). My Augustinian assessment is structured around three trinitarian issues in the Christian theology of religions: (1) the relationship of the ""immanent"" and the ""economic"" Trinity, (2) the relations among the divine persons (both ad intra and ad extra) and (3) the vestigia trinitatis. |In conversation with Augustine, I argue (1) that there is good reason to question the claim that the ""Trinity"" represents the key to a new understanding of religious diversity, (2) that current ""use"" of trinitarian theology in the Christian theology of religions appears to be having a deleterious effect upon the doctrine, and (3) that the trinitarian problems I document in the theology of religions also encumber attempts to relate trinitarian doctrine to a variety of other contemporary issues including personhood, ecclesiology, society, politics and science. I further argue that contemporary theology is driven by a problematic understanding of what it means for a doctrine of the Trinity to be ""relevant"" and that Augustine challenges us to rethink the ""relevancy"" of trinitarian doctrine.",,,English,REVIEW

Psalm 118 is the longest psalm consisting of 176 verses, organised into 22 strophes, with eight verses per strophe. The law of God is the subject of this acrostic psalm. The examination is focused on the manner in which Saint Robert Bellarmine delivers his message, in terms of structure, style, language, and the use of sources. In looking at the structural aspects, the relative length of the commentary for the strophes, and the nature of subtitles are scrutinised. In stylistic considerations the overall features and the uses of stylistic devices are examined. In the use of sources we look at how, where, and why Saint Robert Bellarmine uses scriptural quotations, cites other authors, and discusses the Greek and Hebrew equivalents of selected phrases. All instances of use of sources and stylistic devices are listed and commented upon. Comparisons also are made with the methodology of other authors commenting on Psalm 118, namely Saint Augustine, most frequently cited by Saint Robert Bellarmine and Saint Jerome, the author of Gallican Psalter. References are made to the commentary of Callan, a twentieth-century author. To promote better understanding of this work, related matters, such as biographical details about Saint Robert Bellarmine, Saint Augustine and Saint Jerome is also given as well a presentation in the Psalter, its theme, language and liturgical importance. The conclusion focuses on the identity of intended audience and the benefits of studying good Latin texts. Besides greatly benefiting priests and religious who use the Psalter in their daily prayers, the intended audience includes Protestants as well, since Saint Robert Bellarmine demonstrates makes such frequent use of Saint Augustine, who is greatly respected by Protestants. Recommendations are made for promoting Latin literacy and methods of commenting on Latin texts are suggested, which would promote this aim.",,,English,REVIEW

But what does this mean for freedom, and what does this mean for moral responsibility? In this thesis we will examine the grounds of moral responsibility in Lonergan's early works on Thomas Aquinas' theory of operative grace. This issue is of fundamental importance to ethics, as it will determine the nature of our ability to act morally, and our limitations. Therefore through this thesis we will see that Lonergan's early works on operative grace are also of fundamental importance to ethics. We will begin with the Pelagian controversy, where the question first emerged. Then we will examine Lonergan's philosophical and methodological assumptions as he began his ""apprenticeship"" to Aquinas. And finally, we will examine the actual content of Lonergan's presentation. What will become evident is that this is a complex question; in fact, it pushes human reason to its limits. Ultimately, it may only be able to be resolved by taking a stand on the nature of the universe, a stand similar to the one in physics, in which one accepts the worldview of classical or quantum physics.",,,English,REVIEW

Macleod's Alexander MacDonald and Laurence's Morag Gunn seek an historical context in which to locate themselves, and their ancestral stories help to form the underpinnings of their individual identities, but also challenge each protagonist to re-mediate these experiences through the lens of the more advanced modes of communication that are available in the late twentieth century. The transition from orality to literacy and beyond also has a profound effect on the protagonists' conceptualization of home and nation. The work of a number of media theorists, including Benedict Anderson, Roland Barthes, Walter Benjamin, Stanley Cavell, Ronald Deibert, and Walter Ong, provide the basis for an analytical framework in which to locate these works. David Williams' criticism of media influences in a number of Canadian works opens a space for the discussion of how these theorists address the ontological complexities of the interweaving of media and narrative. This reading of the two novels contends that, although Diviners (1974) is earlier than Mischief (1999) in terms of publication, it is actually Laurence's novel that takes the more postmodern approach in its hybridity of form, as well as its social content. while Alexander, wittingly or not, is implicated in ""museumizing"" his oral Gaelic culture by committing it to print, Morag moves through oral tales to photography and into a far more fluid ""past-present"" that is well served by her innovative ""Memorybank Movies."" Moreover, the multimedia techniques that characterize Morag's narrative anticipate hypertext and create an epistemology of a plural, hybrid nation that leaves a living legacy for Morag's Metis daughter Pique and affirms a plural, overlapping collage of identities that is truly representative of Canada's multicultural nature.",,,English,REVIEW

Educators have promoted these practices as transformative experiences that encourage students to reflect critically on the world and their experience within it and to develop habits of engaged citizenship that promote sustained commitment to a more just and equitable society. The purpose of this qualitative inquiry is to interrogate and report findings for four key questions: How do college students make meaning of their service-learning experiences? How do service-learning experiences combine with other course activities and prior experiences and personal background to affect college students' attitudes about race and social justice? How do college students communicate what they are learning and the meaning they are making from service-learning experiences? What are the positive and negative effects of service-learning on the development of knowledge, skills, and attitudes about race and social justice for college students from racially and socioeconomically privileged groups? These questions are examined in the context of service-learning assigned as part of an introductory course on schooling in a diverse society within a teacher education program at an urban, Catholic, Jesuit university. Four case study narratives are presented to illustrate the experiences and meaning-making processes of students with racial and socioeconomic privilege. Also presented are findings regarding factors in five key areas across cases that influence service-learning experiences and outcomes: students' family relationships, identity development, and background; previous experiences with and exposure to diversity, poverty, and community service; current perceptions and expectations regarding race, poverty, and the role of service; service site environment, activities, and relationships; and the connection of service-learning to the course content, instructor, and teaching methods. Finally, implications are discussed for service-learning and teacher education programs, including student development perspectives, course design, service site selection, realistic expectations for courses and students, and the types of prolonged experience and cross-cultural engagement that lead students to develop a commitment to multicultural education and an ethos of teaching for social justice.",,,English,REVIEW

The year 1540 coincides with the beginning of the Society of Jesus and their entrance into the missionary field alongside the Franciscan and Dominican missionary orders, all subsets of the Roman Catholic Church. The Jesuits' practice of first establishing respect, then influence, and eventually working for religious conversion proved far more effective than the relatively forceful tack taken by Dominican and Franciscan missionaries. While highly successful, Jesuit missionary techniques sufficiently clashed with the Franciscan and Dominican approaches to arouse the unwelcome interest of several papal inquiries, and contributed in large part to the dissolution of the Society in 1773. Within this era, three regions stand out as most valuable for their historical and biographical abundance, as well as their evolving political structures. India, Japan, and China all experienced significant missionary activity by different Catholic orders while their political systems evolved from feudal to national incarnations. Further, there was no dearth of European economic and political interest in these regions, creating a controversial social backdrop to missionary efforts very similar to that experienced by modern U.S. special operations personnel. Finally, the political, cultural and ideological characteristics are sufficiently varied between regions to permit distillation of a useful political and social influence heuristic applicable in a wide variety of special operations circumstances. The author examines the most successful Jesuit practices, creates a general model of their approach, and draws parallels to similar contemporary challenges to special operations forces.",,,English,KEEP

The marginalization of affectivity impoverishes moral theory and the moral life. Therefore, affectivity needs to be positively incorporated into theories of normativity and moral action. Karl Rahner's retrieval of concupiscentia lays the groundwork to reintegrate affectivity with the capacities of reason in order to utilize both as sources of moral knowledge. He asserts that theological concupiscence describes the existential relationship between nature (finitude) and person (freedom).|Rahner's perspective on theological concupiscence incorporated into moral theology with the fundamental option theory---which places human action in the context of grace---recast the manner in which moral theologians define and comprehend moral acts. Right action could no longer simply be read from nature, nor was right moral action achieved by simply following the faith community's norms and avoiding proscribed behaviors. Klaus Demmer connects the fundamental option to vocational decisions providing a framework for a transcendental analysis of moral action. In this context, the dialectical relationship between experience and insight comes to the fore. Insights set the stage for new experiences of grace, which in turn lead to nuanced or new insights. The nuanced or new insights should lead to new forms of action in the world.|Sidney Callahan, Beverly Harrison, and Margaret Farley deliberately integrate affectivity into their psychological or moral theory, offsetting the split between affectivity and reason. In doing so, they affirm the reality that as humans we are affective-reasoning beings. In addition, Farley uses ""embodied spirits"" or ""inspirited bodies"" to discuss human freedom and finitude drawing attention to our embodiment as an aspect of theological concupiscence. Together, they help recast the person-nature relationship (theological concupiscence) in a broader moral theological context allowing for a positive role for affectivity in normative and moral action theories. This re-configured matrix permits a more harmonious and reciprocal relationship between affectivity and reason where both can be utilized as resources for normative and moral action theories, enriching moral theory, our moral reasoning, and our view of the moral life.",,,English,KEEP

At the heart of this preoccupation lie Balthasar's reflections on what Martin Heidegger referred to as the existential fact of man's openness to Being. For Balthasar, this Heideggerian insight is to be understood in terms of an encounter between finite human freedom and infinite divine freedom. One can argue that Balthasar's focus on ""the encounter"" is the internal logic guiding his literary output prior to the writing of his famous trilogy and that this internal logic determines Balthasar's understanding of the relationship between form (Gestalt ) and freedom (Freiheit )---arguably the two central themes of his mature thought. This dissertation examines Balthasar's understanding of the encounter, while attempting to document how the encounter is the interpretive key to his entire literary oeuvre. Such an examination will not only make possible a coherent reading of his overall thought but also present that thought in terms of a singular and ubiquitous theme. The first part of the dissertation will address the emergence of the encounter as the central preoccupation of Balthasar's thought. First, an analysis will be given of his engagement with modern German thinkers in his early work Apokalypse tier deutschen Seele, in which he identifies the turn to the subject of modern German thought as a tragic misreading of the encounter with the infinite. Second, an examination of Balthasar's subsequent theological response to the phenomenon of a dominant subjectivity will be considered in light of Balthasar's retrieval of patristic anthropology and Christology. The major patristic figures to be assayed will be Origen, Gregory of Nyssa, and Maximus the Confessor. The second part will document the development of a synthesis in Balthasar's early theological insights on the encounter by presenting the philosophical and psychological dimensions of the encounter that he provides in his Wahrheit der Welt and Die Christ und die Angst. The third part will explore the relationship between the two central themes of Balthasar's trilogy---Gestalt and freedom---and demonstrate how Balthasar's earlier work on the encounter is the key to understanding this relationship as it is worked out in Herrlichkeit and Theodramatik. Final remarks will address recent criticisms of Balthasar's thought, a proposal of the originality of Balthasar's reading of the encounter, and a critique of the only other reading available in English of the logic of Balthasar's thought.",,,English,REVIEW

Conversion is the shift that includes changes in the interior process of a person, the way one regards an issue, one's actions, and one's openness to God. Conversion is a technical word as defined by Bernard Lonergan in his book, Method in Theology (1971). It does not refer to a change of religious affiliation. It does refer to an inner change of heart (affective conversion), a change of viewpoint (intellectual conversion), actions enacted out of a choice of values over satisfaction (moral conversion), and ultimately the inner shift that occurs when grasped by God and moved in love (religious conversion). These questions will be explored through psychological considerations, understandings of spiritual development, theological reflection, and the call beyond to authentic self-transcending intentional loving",,,English,REVIEW

This dissertation proposes a corrective to this conflation: To become the critical component of a public Roman Catholic global just peacebuilding ethic, nonviolence must be understood as distinct from pacifism, as integral to as well as transformative of just-war tradition, and as unifying just war theory and pacifism coherently within Catholic social teaching. The author argues this thesis in four steps. One, Reinhold Niebuhr forged theological ethics' conflation of nonviolence with pacifism through his Christian realist polemics against fellow liberal Protestant Christian pacifists in the 1930s. That conflation migrated into Catholic ethics in the 1950s by way of Protestant ethicist Paul Ramsey and Jesuit John Courtney Murray's shared aim of reclaiming just war theory for the nuclear age. Since 1950, political scientist Gene Sharp's research into nonviolence flatly contradicts Christian ethics' conflation of nonviolence with pacifism. Two, the U.S. Catholic bishops' peace pastoral (1983) and tenth anniversary statement compound the inherited conflation and fail to differentiate nonviolence from pacifism even after witnessing the 1989 nonviolent revolutions. Three, Paul VI and John Paul II's annual World Day of Peace messages (1968–2005) introduce nonviolence into Catholic social teaching but do not conflate nor attempt to integrate nonviolence into just-war tradition. Four, using Sharp's theory of political power to differentiate nonviolence as force from pacifism, the author claims Christian ethics must evaluate strategic nonviolent conflict force with just-war criteria. Then, Christian ethics can begin to craft a coherent global just peacebuilding ethic from within a renewing just-war tradition.--Author's abstract.",,,English,REVIEW

Within Tupi villages, colonial missions and European courts, these ritual vestments played a key role in the creation of a pan-Atlantic colonial interculture. Produced from feathers of the scarlet ibis, these capes played an important role in Tupi corporeality and community. My dissertation attends to the physical qualities of the extant capes and examines the discourses that early modern chroniclers and modern anthropologists constructed around them. Letters by Jesuit missionaries in Brazil surprisingly reveal the continued manufacture and use of Tupi feathered capes within the aldeia (mission) system in both indigenous and Christian rituals. Jesuit missionaries also shipped the capes to Europe, where with other artifacts they extended the conceptual space of colonialism to the Old World. They traveled along social, mercantile and political networks, and entered scholarly and princely collections, where they were studied for their technical mastery and redeployed within court pageantry. ""Brazil"" and the ""Tupinamba"" were concepts mediated by missionaries, merchants, slaves and indigenes in the spatial realms of ports, plantations, missions, marketplaces and courts. The financial incentives of the brazilwood and sugar industries drove European involvement with Brazilian peoples and coastal forests. The Tupi and their plumed artifacts traveled alongside these exported commodities, tangible indices of European economic interests in the New World. By constructing a socio-cultural ""biography"" of the Tupi feathered capes, I trace their changing functions and value as they move from place to place. As ritual vestments, they contributed to the social coding within and among Tupi kinship groups and colonial intermediaries, including early modern merchants, scholars and princes. A reification of the process of social construction, the capes were instrumental in the performance of identity and agency in the colonial nexus. By examining the intersection of these objects with a series of early modern places, people, and institutions I contribute to our knowledge of colonial indigenous traditions within Brazil and of the institutional and economic basis of European engagement with the New World.",,,English,REVIEW

This revised natural law approach, in turn, specifies a third model of creation that I have termed ""limited co-creator."" As a corrective to these earlier models, the limited co-creator model steers a course between the extremes of a stewardship position that severely restricts genetic manipulation and a created co-creator position that some advocates have used to justify unlimited genetic manipulation.|Relying on the insights of such theologians as Karl Rahner, Wilhem Korff, and Franz Böckle, this investigation argues that a retrieved natural law position is grounded by a properly construed relationship between nature and person where nature is foundational to person and person functions as the sufficient criterion for the universality of moral judgment. It also argues that this properly construed relationship between nature and person presupposes a theological horizon that inspires reason and is further specified by it. Klaus Demmer's anthropological implications of faith are used in this study to guide moral reason in its assessment of the four types of genetic engineering potentially available to human beings, including somatic cell therapy, germ-line gene therapy, enhancement somatic engineering, and germ-line enhancement, prior to going down the clinical path. The limited co-creator model that is specified by this approach avoids a naturalism that makes nature normative, a naïve rationalism that rejects the insights of faith, and an isolating fideism that marginalizes reason by making the insights of faith impervious to analysis.",,,English,REVIEW

This required them to understand the Indians, their customs, and their languages. His desire to engage with Indians marked a break in traditional patterns of interpretation, despite the conventional discursive understanding Biard brought with him from France. Furthermore, his tense relationship with secular interests at Port Royal degenerated into a war of accusations about Biard's involvement in the 1613 destruction of the colony. In defending himself from these allegations, Biard publically verbalized his clear recommendations for how future Jesuits should run their missions. Both his interactions with Indians and his relationship with traders helped him define a unique missionary strategy that left a lasting legacy for future Jesuit missionaries.",,,English,KEEP

The Virgin Mary was on the move, headed westward with relic in tow. Jesuits strove to connect themselves with this alluring myth from the founding days of their Society. A legend in their own right, Jesuits quickly gained recognition for their organization, versatility and successful conversions of remote peoples. However, Jesuit diffusion of the Madonna of Loreto in the Americas in the seventeenth century shows a different side to their missionary efforts. Their portaging of the sacred was piecemeal and intensely personal. Lauretan devotion also took root in unexpected ways among Jesuit converts. This dissertation chronicles how the Madonna of Loreto jumped the Atlantic in the late 1600s. My central question is: How was the Lauretan devotion transformed during the course of local encounters on both sides of ocean? I consider how an Italian devotion came to transcend not only continental and oceanic boundaries, but also national, imperial, and Jesuit networks. I focus on three portable components of the devotion that traveled and changed: the Holy House, the name ""Loreto,"" and the Madonna statue. In tracking these, I reveal how Loreto was moving via pilgrimage, architectural replication, the litany, mission nomenclature, processions, invocations, and refugee displacement. The human agents behind this religious transfer include Jesuits such as Oratio Torsellino, Juan María Salvatierra, and Pierre-Joseph-Marie Chaumonot. Jesuits found partners in the devout Huron of Lorette (Canada), Moxos Indians of Loreto (Peru/Bolivia), Monquí of Loreto Conchó (Baja California), and Dalmatians of Trsat (Croatia). Though these people resided far from Loreto's original shrine, they were the ones who made of Loreto a globally resonant devotion. Overall, I call attention to a diverse, peripherally located cast of actors and set of Catholic practices. These were the forces that propelled the Loreto devotion out of Italy in the seventeenth century. Lauretan movement counters the old trope that Catholic (and Jesuit-led) expansion was centralized and hyper-regulated. I conclude instead that Catholicism spread through individual religiosity, independent initiative, and shared experiences of survival on the frontier.",,,English,KEEP

São histórias sobre os antigos mexicanos e peruanos, bem como sobre seus descendentes, nos vice-reinos da Nova Espanha e Peru. Os costumes com substâncias foram retidos como elementos essenciais da idolatria (a falsa religião dos índios); além de usadas em cerimônias e feitiçarias, algumas plantas e poções seriam inclusive adoradas como divindades. Dividimos os capítulos por contextos e grupos de obras/autores: (i) para o contexto geral de consolidação do império espanhol na América, analisamos o dominicano Bartolomé de las Casas e o jesuíta José de Acosta; (ii) para os tempos dos missionários mendicantes na Nova Espanha do séc. XVI, o franciscano Bernardino de Sahagún e o dominicano Diego Durán; (iii) para a época de auge da extirpação da idolatria no séc. XVII, os curas Hernando Ruiz de Alarcón e Jacinto de la Serna na Nova Espanha, e o jesuíta Pablo Joseph de Arriaga no Peru; (iv) analisamos o cronista indígena peruano Felipe Guaman Poma de Ayala na virada dos sécs. XVI–XVII. Outras fontes foram utilizadas, destacando-se os tratados sobre as medicinas dos índios escritos pelos doutores espanhóis Nicolas Monardes, Francisco Hernández e Juan de Cárdenas, assim como de um médico indígena mexicano, Martín de la Cruz. Os principais assuntos discutidos: os juízos de proveito das medicinas que embriagam; os sentidos do vício por meio das substâncias, entre hábito contranatural e veículo para os pecados; a noção de perda do juízo como efeito natural da embriaguez, mas que abre espaço para a intervenção demoníaca; representações dos usos nos sacrifícios, comunhões, feitiçarias, e a idolatria de plantas e poções. Esses assuntos são analisados tendo em vista que a idolatria não informa apenas o estereótipo e o caminho da interdição dos costumes, pois, de outro lado, nomeia os saberes e poderes locais e sua vitalidade, num ambiente de choques, negociações e acomodações político-culturais.||From a cultural history point of view, we analyze perceptions and policies over indigenous relation to psycho-actives (alcoholic beverages, stimulants and hallucinogens), based on treatises written from the middle of the 16th century to the middle of the 17th century at the Spanish-American world. They are histories about the anciant Mexicans and Peruvians, as well as about their descendents from the vice royalties of New Spain and Peru. In such works, the habits related to psycho-actives were believed to be essential elements of the idolatry (the indigenous false religion); besides being used in ceremonies and sorcery, some plants and potions were also worshipped as divinities. We organize the chapters according to the contexts and groups of document sources/authors: (i) for the general context of the Spanish empire consolidation in America, we analyze the Dominican Bartolomé de las Casas and the Jesuit Joseph de Acosta; (ii) for the New Spain mendicant missionaries times in the 16th century, the Franciscan Bernardino de Sahagún and the Dominican Diego Durán; (iii) from the extirpation of idolatry strongest period in the 17th century, the vicars Hernando Ruiz de Alarcón and Jacinto de la Serna; and (iv) from the turning of the 16th to the 17th century, the Peruvian Indian chronicler Felipe Guaman Poma de Ayala. Other document sources were also consulted, in particular treatises covering indigenous medicines, like those written by the Spanish physicians Nicolas Monardes, Francisco Hernández and Juan de Cárdenas, and also by an Indian doctor from Mexico, Martín de la Cruz. The main subjects we discuss in the work are: the views of benefits from the medicines that inebriate; the meanings of vice associated to substances, from a non-natural habit to a passport for sins; the notion of going out of mind as a natural consequence of inebriation, but which opens the possibility of demonic intrusion; usage representations in sacrifices, communions, witchcraft, and the idolatry of plants and potions. All those issues are analyzed bearing in mind that idolatry tell us not only about the stereotype and the pathways of habits forbiddance, but also distinguishes the local knowledge and powers, and its vitality, all taking place in an environment of political and cultural clashes, negotiations and accommodations.",,,Portuguese,REVIEW

Procedeu-se da concepção de que a preservação do patrimônio é uma ação cultural, ou seja, produto de um tempo e espaço determinado, e de que existiu a pretensão de resgatar, através do patrimônio tombado pela Comissão, uma memória específica para contribuir para a construção de uma idéia de Nação Argentina. Para isso se objetivou estudar o contexto no qual se inseriu a ação da Comissão, os agentes que nela atuaram, as idéias orientadoras do grupo, os valores que resgataram, as particularidades da gestão, o patrimônio que estabeleceram, as características da intervenção física no patrimônio. Para tanto, articularam-se várias pesquisas: a realizada nos Boletins da CNMMyLH (1938–1946), a análise dos Decretos de Tombamento dos Bens definidos como Patrimônio, os textos elaborados pelos personagens vinculados ao trabalho da Comissão, e a desenvolvida nos arquivos da Dirección General de Arquitectura (DGA) em Córdoba. Esta abordagem permitiu tomar, como ponto de partida, o entendimento geral da ação da CN, de suas palavras, de seus ritos e procedimentos, para chegar ao estudo de um exemplo concreto de intervenção: aquela realizada durante a década de 1940 no Conjunto Jesuítico da Igreja da Companhia de Jesus e da Residência dos Padres, em Córdoba, Argentina.||This paper studied a period of the History of the Cultural Heritage Preservation in Argentina, between 1938 and 1946, the years when Ricardo Levene was the president of the Comisión Nacional de Museos y de Monumentos y Lugares Historicos (CNMMyLH). The work started with the concept that the heritage preservation is a cultural action, in other words, product of a specific time and space, and that there was the intent to rescue, through the definition of the preserved heritage, a specific memory to contribute to the construction of a concept of Argentinean Nation. The context in which the commission action was inserted, the people who acted in it, the advising ideas of the group, the values which have been rescued, the peculiarities of the management, the established heritage and the characteristics of the physical intervention on the heritage have all been studied in order to achieve this. Some research has been done in order to complete these objectives: The one performed on the CNMMyLH bulletins (1938–1946), analysis of the Decree-Laws that defined the heritage, the texts created by the characters related to the work of the Commission, and the one developed in the files of the Dirección General de Arquitectura (DGA) in Córdoba. This approach has allowed the general understanding of the action of the CN, their words, their rites and procedures, to be taken as a ground zero, in order to study a concrete case of intervention in the heritage: The one done during the 1940s in the Church and Residence buildings of the Jesuit Fathers in Córdoba City, Argentina.",,,Portuguese,REVIEW

(1878–1915). Rousselot was a theologian of major significance in twentieth-century Catholic thought. Henri de Lubac, Joseph Maréchal, Karl Rahner, and Hans Urs von Balthasar all express an indebtedness to his thought. Among his many philosophical and theological contributions, Rousselot set the stage for la nouvelle théologie, a highly controversial and widely influential movement within Catholic theology that insisted in new and radical ways on the intimate integration of nature and grace.|Specifically, this study explicates Rousselot's understanding of the relationship between nature and grace in Thomas Aquinas. Rousselot offers his interpretation of Thomas primarily in his major thesis of 1908, L'Intellectualisme de saint Thomas. Rousselot focuses on Thomas's doctrine of the intelligent creature's “natural desire to see God” [desiderium naturale visionis Dei], especially as Thomas presents it in the Summa contra Gentiles and the Compendium theologiae.|As this study demonstrates, Rousselot's reading of Thomas is a tacit response to the philosophical apologetics of Maurice Blondel (1861–1949). Blondel's treatise of 1893 L'Action had exercised considerable influence in Rousselot's day. Rousselot tries to show that Thomas's metaphysical approach to “intelligence” [intellectus] anticipates Blondel's teaching on the openness or receptivity of human existence to a saving God and eternal life. Yet Rousselot also endeavors to prove, in contrast to Blondel's philosophy, that Thomas safeguards the natural power of reason to know reality apart from faith and grace. Rousselot thus effects a delicate balance in Thomas between the intellect's innate dynamism toward God, on the one hand, and the natural integrity of its rational operations here on earth, on the other.|This study seeks to contribute both to the recent scholarship on twentieth-century Thomism as well as to how to read Thomas today. Rousselot draws upon nineteenth-century neo-Scholasticism and the heritage of classic Thomist commentary (namely Cajetan and Suárez) while at the same time paves the way for la nouvelle théologie. Rousselot's work not only reveals an interesting and fruitful moment in the history of Thomism but also offers insights into how Thomas himself conceives the relationship between nature and grace.",,,English,REVIEW

Muitos se propuseram a escrever e refletir sobre a educação formal em Portugal, porém pouco foi feito de modo efetivo, o que praticamente obrigava os intelectuais a repensarem as suas teorias. Na segunda metade do século XVIII, Ribeiro Sanches e Luís António Verney apresentaram algumas propostas que, posteriormente, acabaram também sendo utilizadas pelo Marquês de Pombal. No século XIX, muitos outros intelectuais colaboraram com esse debate: Mousinho de Albuquerque, Passos Manuel, Castilho, Garrett e Herculano, são alguns dos nomes que trouxeram a questão à baila na primeira metade dos Oitocentos. Já, a partir das Conferências do Casino Lisbonense (1871), outra geração entra em cena e continua fomentando o debate sobre os problemas da instrução pública em Portugal. É a partir dessa época que Eça de Queirós registra seu contributo ao discursar, na famosa conferência, sobre o novo estilo literário e, em seguida, disponibilizar nAs Farpas as suas críticas à educação portuguesa, críticas essas que ganham uma nova roupagem no texto Um gênio que era um santo Antero de Quental, em O francesismo, e nas crônicas destinadas à Gazeta de Notícias do Rio de Janeiro. Dessa forma, o objetivo dessa dissertação é, fundamentalmente, analisar os textos de imprensa de Eça de Queirós que têm como temática primordial a questão educacional portuguesa. Para isso, utilizaremos como corpus de análise os textos reunidos em Uma Campanha Alegre (das Farpas: 1871 1872), publicado em dois tomos, 1890–1891; passaremos, ainda, pelos textos publicados na Gazeta de Notícias do Rio de Janeiro (1880 -1897), posteriormente recolhidos nas coletâneas Cartas de Inglaterra (1905), Ecos de Paris (1905), Cartas Familiares e Bilhetes de Paris (1907), além do Prefácio às Aquarelas de João Diniz (1880) e o texto O francesismo, artigo encontrado entre os papéis do escritor, publicado postumamente em 1912 em Ultimas Páginas.||Educational question was always subject of debate among Portuguese intellectuals around 18th and 19th centuries.

In the 19th century, a lot of another intellectuals introduced educational proposal, such as Mouzinho de Albuquerque, Passos Manuel, Castilho, Garrett, Herculano etc., but its important to remember the contribution of group of Conferências do Casino that have like target, other things, the educational reform.

The music is scored for four performers: soprano, flute, oboe, and cello; in addition, there are a number of autonomous robotic instruments which function as the opera's ""continuo"" or ""ritornello"" accompaniment. The opera is not conventionally staged, but rather acted out by robotic elements which display, in a general and symbolic way, the characters, relationships, and actions contained in the drama. The mise en scene for the work is informed by the ""scientific spectacle"" of the late Renaissance polymath Athanasius Kircher, a Jesuit who succeeded Galileo as the Vatican court scientist and is one of the pivotal figures in what is now called the ""Scientific Revolution.""|In a similar way, the opera's music is modeled after a fragment of an imaginary early Venetian opera or intermezzo by a fictitious contemporary of the composers Cavalli and Monteverdi. Operas from this period frequently used Ovid's retellings of Greek and Roman myths as the basis for their dramas.|Rather than a single straightforward narrative, Diane et Actéon is formed of a certain number of retellings of the same story from different perspectives. This is the approach to the myth taken by Klossowski in his book. The work's libretto is composed from many sources, from the Latin text of the Metamorphoses themselves to an early seventeenth century text on the preferred techniques used to stage intermezzi. The source texts are combined, obscured or extended by poetic techniques associated with the ""Language poetry"" movement.|The autonomous, quasi-robotic instruments are simple mechanical sound-producers controlled by small interconnected microprocessors. Each of the microprocessors is programmed with a unique set of instructions and the ""score"" for the mechanical part of the piece is stored in the form of firmware code on the chips themselves.

Son œuvre traduit en effet l’accomplissement poétique d’un cheminement personnel, le passage de l’anglicanisme de l’archevêque William Laud et de son idéal de «beauté de la sainteté» au catholicisme romain issu de la Contre Réforme qui envisage fondamentalement le Beau comme une qualité transcendantale de l’être au même titre que le Bien et le Vrai. C’est à la personne de François de Sales que le poète doit les accents suaves de son éloquence sacrée et la théologie affective du «docteur de l’Amour» marque de son empreinte l’univers du poète. Profondément attaché aux miracles et aux mystères de la foi, Crashaw compose une poésie de la célébration et de la joie qui manifeste l’amour rayonnant de Dieu, dans laquelle la figure médiatrice du Père, le Christ, est le centre et le modèle esthétique de toute Beauté: une théologie du pulchrum, une véritable esthétique théologique est à l’oeuvre dans cette poésie sacramentelle qui explore l’unité et la beauté spécifique de la Révélation chrétienne. Dans une Angleterre encore profondément méfiante du Beau transcendantal, conjonction du sensible et du spirituel, l’oeuvre poétique de Crashaw constitue l’un des plus vibrants témoignages de l’esthétique baroque.||The aim of this thesis is to demonstrate how Richard Crashaw (1612–1649), when faced with the reticence about images he inherited from the iconoclasm of the Reformation as well as from the influence of his father, a Puritan preacher, filled this ""aesthetic vacuum"" through close contact with the Cambridge ""High Church"" set, Jesuit neo-Latin poets and also the saints and martyrs of the Catholic Church. His works are, in fact, the poetic expression of his own personal pilgrimage as he moved from the Anglicanism of Archbishop William Laud, with his ideal of ""the beauty of holiness"", to the Roman Catholicism of the Counter-Reformation which basically regarded Beauty as an inherent transcendental quality in the same way as Good and Truth. The strong influence of Francis de Sales on Crashaw can be seen in his emphasis on sweetness in the divine eloquence. The ""Doctor of Divine Love""'s affective theology also left its imprint on the poet's universe. Deeply attached to the miracles and mysteries of faith, Crashaw composed poems of celebration and joy which reveal God's radiant love and in which the mediating figure of Christ the Son is the centre and the aesthetic model of all Beauty: a theology of the pulchrum, a form of truly theological aesthetics is at work in Crashaw's sacramental poetry which explores the unity and beauty specific to the Christian Revelation. In an England still highly suspicious of transcendental Beauty, the mixture of sensitivity and spirituality in Crashaw's poetic works represents one of the most vibrant expressions of Baroque aesthetics.",,,French,REVIEW

Si les écrits de cet homme prennent tour à tour une orientation politique, économique ou morale, ils présentent, tous, le même intérêt pour la libération de l’Amérique ibérique et, certes, une attention particulière pour le Pérou, terre patrie de ce personnage historique. Eduqué selon les canons rigides du collège jésuite du Cusco, le créole Viscardo est témoin des tensions permanentes entre les secteurs de pouvoir. Débarqué en Ligurie et exilé en Toscane à la suite de la suppression de la Compagnie de Jésus en 1767, le jeune jésuite, qui rejette sans conteste sa condition de vassal espagnol, passe alors l’essentiel de sa vie d’adulte à voyager en Italie et en Grande-Bretagne. Il a une curiosité qui le pousse à comprendre les autres façons de penser et à analyser les révolutions politiques qui annoncent l’arrivée du monde contemporain. Par ses réflexions et grâce à sa brillante culture, il devient un conspirateur militaire et un théoricien politique et économique. Ainsi, il est le premier à réunir fermement sa volonté d’indépendance et à tenir un discours identitaire hispano-américain, et cela, par le biais d’un projet libérateur des colonies espagnoles qui tenait compte du fait que seul l’appui de la Grande-Bretagne permettrait la réalisation des objectifs proposés. Le jésuite, marqué par cet ostracisme involontaire, se veut citoyen du Pérou et de l’Amérique hispanique dans son ensemble. Il s’agit d’une seule patrie qui doit être libérée dans sa totalité territoriale : il veut l’indépendance absolue. Grâce à lui, à l’aube des révolutions indépendantistes, l’Amérique commence à se détacher de l’Espagne et à établir les fondements de son identité.||Juan Pablo Viscardo Y Guzman, a precursor of Latin American Independence ideas, was one of the most interesting personalities of the 18th century. The man's writings may have had a military, political, economic or moral orientation but they all had the same interest in the Liberation of Latin America and particularly in Peru, Viscardo's homeland. Educated at Cuzco Jesuitical college according to rigid canons, Creole Viscardo witnessed permanent tensions between the spheres of Power. After the Society of Jesus was expelled out of Spanish dominions in 1767, the young Jesuit landed in Tuscany and, while he strongly rejected his condition as a Spanish vassal, he spent most of his adult life travelling in Italy and Great Britain. His curiosity led him to understand different ways of thinking and analysing the political revolutions which heralded the advent of the contemporary world. His thoughts and outstanding knowledge made him a conspirator as well as a political and economic theorist. He was the first thinker to assert a strong wish for independence and a clearly Latin American identity through a liberation project for the Spanish colonies which stated that only the support of Great Britain would make the designed prospects become reality. The Jesuit, unintentionally ostracized, saw himself as a citizen of Peru and of Latin America as a whole. He considered the Hispanic provinces one fatherland which had to be liberated in its territorial completeness - he demanded absolute independence. Thanks to Viscardo, in the eve of wars of independence, Latin America started to cut itself off from Spain and build the foundation of its identity.",(Paris),,French,REVIEW

These satirical anti-Jesuit pamphlets by Nicolas Jouin, known as the 'Sarcelades', were collected posthumously in 'Le Vrai Recueil des Sarcelles' of 1764. The texts purport to be in the patois of the peasants of Sarcelles and show features which may be paralleled in the vernacular speech of Paris and elsewhere, and even correspond with features of contemporary colloquial French. The study may appeal to French historical sociolinguists interested in reconstructing spoken language of the past, and particularly in the history of vernacular speech of Paris since the Middle Ages through to the eighteenth century, in the context of the development of urban dialects. In order to set the scene for a linguistic description of Jouin’s work the limited biographical information available was collated. Then a period of bibliographical research led to acquisition of copies of the texts which were to be studied in order to identify and examine their non-standard linguistic features. Firstly the process of growth of urban dialects was discussed, and then the development of the Paris vernacular in particular. Then attention was turned to direct written evidence in the form of commentary and to a number of texts from the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries containing features of the Paris vernacular. These had already been analysed by certain historical linguists, although the texts in the 'Sarcelades' had hitherto only been briefly mentioned. However, here they are considered to be of sufficient interest to be examined more closely, although it had to be established whether Jouin’s texts containing a selection of non-standard features could be regarded as an accurate depiction of the Paris vernacular at the period. The non-standard phonetic, morphological, syntactic, and lexical features in the texts were therefore compared with findings in other texts by previous commentators. Following these analyses it was noted to what extent the relative frequency of the variables correlates with the salience of certain features in popular speech in Paris at the period, as already observed in other texts by previous commentators, and it was concluded that in general established characteristics of the 'patois de Paris' at the period are to be found in the 'Sarcelades', even though there do remain certain features which do not appear to be generally attested elsewhere. Nevertheless, despite reservations concerning the authenticity of some of the non-standard features employed by Jouin, by bringing attention to this little-known series of texts this study may help to claim a place for the Sarcelades amongst the corpus of texts which reflect aspects of the lower-class sociolect, the 'patois de Paris', at the period.",,,English,REVIEW

Dans l'Eglise Catholique Romaine, le mariage est une institution sacrée, qui ne peut être dissoute. Les deux contractans sont libres, la femme devient la libre partenaire de son mari, elle n'est plus considérée comme un objet. Alors, pourquoi le mariage, qui est une vraie joie pour un chrétien, devient-il un calvaire pour les missionnaires? Il leur fallait régulariser les mariages invalides contractés avec empêchements, refuser les dispenses de disparité de culte et résorber la polygamie, entre autres... Le mariage occupe une place de choix dans l'apostolat des missionnaires du XIXème siècle, ce sacrement permettant de garantir l'homogénéité des communautés chrétiennes. Mais il est également la source de nombreux tourments pour le missionnaire, car le seul modèle matrimonial valable est le modèle européen et par là même, il ne tolère aucune acculturation. Cette thèse complexe a été élaborée à l'aide des archives et des publications des 4 principaux ordres missionnaires français en Chine: les Franciscains, les Jésuites, les Lazaristes et les Missions Etrangères de Paris. Une première partie présentera les missions catholiques françaises en Chine de 1860 à 1940. La seconde partie traitera des descriptions du mariage coutumier par les missionnaires et la troisième partie des manuels de droit canonique utilisés par ces derniers. Enfin, la quatrième et dernière partie décrira toutes les étapes du mariage catholique chinois.||What do we know about the matrimonial policy followed by the French missionaries in China from 1860 to 1940? What were the difficulties in combining chinese customs with the canon law? Generally, in imperial China, a woman, engaged since infancy, married a man in order to give him heirs. She also became a servant dedicated to the temple of the ancestors and helped her husband to perform his filial duties. In the Roman Catholic Church, marriage is a holy institution which cannot be dissolved. The two persons who contract it are free; the wife becomes her husband's associate, she is not considered to be a possession. Marriage, which is a joy to Christians, becomes a ""calvary"" to missionaries. They had to regularize invalid weddings contracted with impediments, they had to refuse religion disparity dispensations, they had to suppress polygamy and so on...

First, a database of 179 trials and 355 accused witches, drawn from all over the territory of early modern Poland (excluding Lithuania), and dating from 1511 to c. 1770. Second, literary sources including anti-demonological polemic, legal treatises, guidebooks to rural economy, sermon collections, humanist and Jesuit poetry, and popular ribald literature. Part 2 examines the ways that ordinary peasant magic, directed against imagined witches, provided the conceptual building blocks for the alleged crimes of witches. The accused inverted or exaggerated their own practices to create the confessions of malefice, night flight, and the meeting at Bald Mountain. In this part I also examine the use of Christian sacraments in witchcraft; the Tridentine context of intense Eucharistic devotion promoted accusations and confessions about the desecrated Body of Christ. Part 3 examines the figure of the Devil in the Polish witch-trials. The devil bore strong resemblance to folkloristic house-spirits, and to the untimely dead, especially unbaptized children. Polish witches imagined themselves making pacts not with the Prince of Darkness but with a nature-spirit or imp. Accused witches ""indigenized"" elite motifs of demon-sex; turning them into stories of the nurture provided to house-spirits. Witchcraft is an imaginary crime, but witches are real people: they are people who have come to be imagined by others in their community, and often by themselves, as practitioners of the imagined crime of witchcraft. This dissertation explores the various ways by which witchcraft was imagined in early modern Poland. In particular, it pays close attention to the self-representations of accused witches, as they attempted, in their confessions under torture, to preserve the integrity of their imagined selves. Part 1 puts the witch-trials into their social, economic, and legal context. It attempts a characterisation of the social position of accused witches: they were usually married peasant-women, poor but not destitute. It traces increasing number of witch-trials in the late 17th century in response to the economic and demographic crises of the mid-century. It also shows how legal practice tended to encourage high execution rates but to discourage the spread of witch-trials through chain-accusation.",,,English,REVIEW

F., 1904–1984","Purpose of the thesis. In this thesis, I investigate the relationship of ethics and economics. I situate this inquiry in the context of conversations in Canadian Catholic social ethics. Further, I illustrate this relationship by focussing on the function of profit in an economy. I am addressing ethics and economics out of my own concern about the systemic social and economic problems that so many people face, nationally and internationally, and that have damaged the natural systems of the planet. The Roman Catholic tradition has a long history of social teaching that has spoken out against economic situations that have degraded human dignity and freedom. In the Canadian context, there is also a significant tradition in the official church, among theologians, and in community-based organizations to respond to economic injustice. In this thesis, I use representatives from these three areas of Canadian Catholic social ethics to situate the conversation on the relationship of ethics and economics, and to show its contributions and its limits.|Summary and method. This thesis is situated in the context of Canadian Catholic social ethics. My reason for choosing this conversation to investigate the relationship of ethics and economics is my own identity as a Canadian Catholic woman with a long-standing commitment to social justice. I have chosen to illustrate this discussion by focussing on the function of profit in an economy, as profit has become a symbol in the conflicts about economic justice, symbolizing success to some and greed to others. The conversation partners that I have chosen reflect three significant areas of Canadian Catholic social ethics: the Canadian Catholic bishops represent the ""official"" church; Gregory Baum represents the voice of critical theology and critical theory; and Moses Coady and the Antigonish Movement represent the concrete community-based social economic approach. I identify the key contributions of these three conversation partners, noting that they offer a strong grounding in the principles of the Catholic social tradition. They share a deep commitment to challenging an economic situation that threatens the dignity and freedom of people. They all point to the importance of the social economy in its community-based, democratic approach to empowering those who suffer economic injustice. A key limit to all three approaches, however, is the lack of a macroeconomic analysis that could provide an alternative to mainstream analyses and could ground ethical imperatives in its very dynamics.|In addressing this limit, I turn to the work of Bernard Lonergan. Lonergan offers a macroeconomic analysis that is quite unique in that it challenges the limited single-circuit analyses that ground mainstream economics. Lonergan follows the insights of economists like Joseph Schumpeter and develops a two-circuit analysis, one that distinguishes two distinct circuits of productive activity and circulations of payments. With this distinction, Lonergan sets out the activities, relationships, and dynamic rhythms of an economic order. This analysis accounts for the elements of production and payments, their dynamic flows and fluctuations, and their effects on each other. In light of these relationships, Lonergan's macroeconomic analysis allows for an understanding of the function of profit as a social dividend.|Lonergan's macroeconomic analysis is situated in the broader context of his work on the structure of ethics. For Lonergan, there are different meanings of the good that can be distinguished in accordance with increasingly broad horizons of concern: particular goods, goods of order, and value. Economic orders are goods of order that regularly provide particular goods to everyone. As goods of order, they are structures of collaboration and intelligence whose dynamism transcends the narrow limits of self-interest. Goods of order are situated in the broader context of progress, decline, and redemption in history. In this broader context, values function to evaluate whether or not goods of order are performing their tasks of serving the well-being of everyone. While the broader horizon of values can offer challenges and guiding principles to the economic goods of order, they still require the analytical tools to understand how economies can achieve this goal.|As the ultimate goal of solving economic problems, Lonergan's methodology of functional specialization is identified as providing a strategy for interdisciplinary collaboration that sets out the relationships of theological doctrinal directives and systematic analytical response. The eight-fold methodology of functional specialization provides a cycle of discovery and response that strategically raises the foundational question of conversions and self-transcendence in searching for solutions to problems of history. In this way, the question of God's loving presence in history becomes part of the cycle of discovery and response. This ultimately places the solution of economic problems in the context of progress, decline, and redemption in history with a broad methodological strategic response.",,,English,REVIEW

It examines official correspondence and private geographic and statecraft scholarship to outline how India was described in various religious and intellectual traditions of the empire, and in intelligence from the Tibetan, Xinjiang, and maritime frontiers. Based on an analysis of Qing geographic methods, strategic thought and bureaucratic procedures, this dissertation argues that the framework guiding perspectives on India shifted between 1750 and 1847 from a frontier policy to the beginnings of a foreign policy. Frontier policy divided the outside world into discrete units tied to a particular frontier, and analyzed them largely according to local informants and sources. Regional differences in terminology and intelligence made it difficult to commensurate all available information into a single picture. However, by the 1840s Chinese statecraft scholars, particularly Wei Yuan, were able to integrate most available geographic information, and on this basis proposed for the first time a foreign policy that put all imperial frontiers to the service of a single strategic end: the destruction of the British empire in India. Chapter One examines knowledge of India circulating within the empire around 1750. Chapter Two examines the views of India held by the Qianlong emperor and his court, and their influence on private scholarship. Chapter Three examines official cartography and its relationship to Jesuit world maps. Collectively, these chapters argue that Qing scholarship was characterized by 'geographic agnosticism,' considering but not wholly endorsing a range of conflicting geographic conceptions, leading to a great variety of idiosyncratic individual worldviews but no basis for a consensus about the outside world. Chapters Four and Five examine the Qing bureaucracy's response to the rise of British India across several frontiers, paying particular attention to the Macartney embassy and its legacy. Chapter Six examines the growth of private scholarship about India. Chapters Seven and Eight examine the Opium War and its aftermath, showing how the strategic importance of India was grasped and responded to in private statecraft-oriented writings.",,,English,REVIEW

In chapters on Gerard Manley Hopkins, Seamus Heaney, Thomas Hardy, William Butler Yeats, and A. R. Ammons, I argue that the twentieth century sees a crucial change in the representation of conviction, as poets look for ways to replace a pre-Romantic idiom of vision and visitation with a description of the feeling of knowing that feels more suitable for a secular context. For some poets, that older idiom becomes a rich metaphorical resource for describing the feeling of conviction. We all still speak of having had ""a revelation"" when we want to attest to the suddenness and power with which a new idea asserts itself in our consciousness; Seamus Heaney, the latest of the poets I consider, fills his poems with scenes of vision and visitation as a way of answering the same evocative impulse. But many modern poets, Heaney included, recognize an imperative to psychological realism that makes those borrowed metaphors begin to feel inadequate. Here I trace five poets' efforts to invent a more integral and flexible poetic language for the intensity of the mind in engagement with its ideas: from Gerard Manley Hopkins's desire to make the music of his poetry reflective of a subtle kinesthetics of faith, to Ammons's delicate voicing, in idiom, tempo, and cadence, of the changing intensity of his own creative absorption. I argue that having a language for the feeling of conviction -- one that feels appropriate in a secular context -- furthers these poets' efforts to represent the life of the mind more generally and to represent spiritual experience in its distinctively modern forms.",,,English,REVIEW

Bernard Lonergan on the Cross as Communication,"Chestnut Hill, MA",Boston College,,PhD diss.,,,http://hdl.handle.net/2345/2235,,20th century,Theology -- Christology|Theology -- Method -- Communication,,"Lonergan, Bernard J. F., 1904–1984","This dissertation aims at understanding Bernard Lonergan’s understanding of how the passion of Jesus Christ is salvific. Because salvation is of human persons in a community, a history, and a cosmos, the first part of the dissertation examines Lonergan’s cosmology with an emphasis on his anthropology. For Lonergan the cosmos is a dynamic, interrelated hierarchy governed by the processes of what he calls “emergent probability.” Within the universe of emergent probability, humanity is given the ability to direct world processes with critical intelligence, freedom, love, and cooperation with each other and with the larger world order. This ability is not totally undirected. Rather, it has a natural orientation, a desire or eros for ultimate goodness, truth, beauty, and love, i.e. for God. When made effective through an authentic, recurrent cycle of experience, questioning, understanding, judgment, decision, action, and cooperation, this human desire for God results in progress. However, when this cycle is damaged by bias, sin and its evil consequences distort the order of creation, both in human persons and in the larger environment. Over time, the effects of sin and bias produce cumulative, self-feeding patterns of destruction, or decline. In answer to this distortion, God gives humanity the gift of grace. Grace heals and elevates human persons. Through the self-gift of divine, unrestricted Love and the Incarnate Word, God works with human sensitivity, imagination, intelligence, affect, freedom, and community to produce religious, moral, and intellectual conversion, and to form the renewed, renewing community Lonergan calls “cosmopolis” and the body of Christ. Building on this cosmology and anthropology, the second part of the dissertation turns to the culmination of God’s solution to the problem of sin and evil in the suffering and death of Jesus of Nazareth, the Christ, on the cross at Calvary. The cross does not redeem creation by destroying its order, nor does it redeem humanity by revoking its freedom. Rather, the cross redeems the world by working with the order and freedom of creation and humanity to fulfill their natural processes and purposes. Just as from all possible world orders, God chose the order of emergent probability and human freedom, from all possible ways of redeeming that order, God chose the way of the cross. How does the cross redeem a free humanity in a world of emergent probability? For Lonergan, the best way to understand the cross is through the analogy of communication. This communication is in two parts. First, the cross is a communication, primarily, of humanity to God. Lonergan calls this part “vicarious satisfaction.” He takes the general analogy from Anselm of Canterbury’s Cur Deus Homo?. But rather than understanding satisfaction primarily in an economic context of debt (as Anselm does), Lonergan situates it in the higher context of interpersonal psychology: Sin creates a rupture in the relationships between human persons and God, among human persons, and among all parts of creation. Christ’s vicarious satisfaction flows from a non-ruptured relationship. It expresses a perfect concord of the human and the divine, through its threefold communication of (1) a perfect knowledge and love of God and humanity, (2) a perfect knowledge and sorrow for the offense that sin is, (3) and a perfect knowledge and detestation of the evil sin causes. Conceived as a communication in the context of ruptured interpersonal relationships, Lonergan’s analogical understanding of the cross as vicarious satisfaction avoids Anselm’s understanding’s tendency to be misinterpreted as “satispassion” or “substitutionary penal atonement.” The other major part to Lonergan’s analogy of the cross as communication is called the “Law of the Cross.” While vicarious satisfaction is mainly Christ’s achievement prescinding from the cooperation of human freedom in a world of emergent probability, the Law of the Cross proposes that Christ’s crucifixion is an example and an exhortation to human persons. On the cross, Jesus wisely and lovingly transforms the evil consequences of sin into a twofold communication to humanity of a perfect human and divine (1) knowledge and love for humanity and (2) knowledge and condemnation of sin and evil. This twofold communication invites a twofold human response: the repentance of sin and a love for God and all things. This love and repentance form a reconciled relationship of God and humanity. Furthermore, when reconciled with God, a human person will tend to be moved to participate in Christ’s work by willingly taking on satisfaction for one’s own sin as well as the vicarious satisfaction for others’ sins. Such participatory vicarious activity invites still other human persons to repent and reconcile with God and other persons, and furthermore to engage in their own participatory acts of satisfaction and communication. Thus, Christ’s own work and human participation in his work are objective achievements as well as moving or inspiring examples. However, while Christ’s work and our participation are moving, their movements do not operate by necessity. Nor are the appropriate human responses of repentance, love, personal satisfaction, and vicarious satisfaction in any way forced upon human persons. Consequently, the cross as communication operates in harmony with a world of emergent probability and in cooperation with human freedom. With the cross as communication, redemption is reconciliation, a reconciliation that spreads historically and communally by human participation in the divine initiative. This is God’s solution to the problem of evil, according to Lonergan. Because God wills ultimately for human persons to be united to God and to all things by love, God wills freedom, and God allows the possibility of sin and evil. But sin and evil do not please God. Out of infinite wisdom, God did not do away with evil through power, but converted evil into a communication that preserves, works with, and fulfills the order of creation and the freedom of humanity.",,,English,REVIEW

His major work, the three volume Mysterium Fidei (L921), provides an integrated account of sacrifice, one which responsively embraces the multiple and often controversial aspects of the topic of sacrifice. De la Taille rejects a supercessionist treatment of Hebrew ritual sacrifice; he incorporates a sophisticated theory of sacrifice as sign and gift; and he allows the fullness of theological tradition-scripture, the Fathers (East and West), Thomistic thought, conciliar and papal teaching, and the witness of liturgical prayer and mystical theology to inform his theory of Christian sacrifice. In surprising ways, de la Taille's magisterial work on eucharistic sacrifice forestalls the post-Vatican II liberal anxieties about sacrifice. He decidedly challenges the formidable heritage of sixteenth and seventeenth century immolation-focused eucharistic theology by providing a patristically-rich theology of sacrifice, one that stands rooted in a spirituality of prayer and ascetic practice which cannot be segregated from the ecclesial oblation of Christ's sacrifice. With his focus on the affect and desire of the offerer of sacrifice, de la Taille anticipates the 'subjective turn' that emerged in mid-twentieth century eucharistic theology, and in a way that revitalizes the critical role of ecclesial ritual sacrifice in the transformation of that desire.",,,English,REVIEW

Dans notre recherche, nous nous proposons de faire une étude monographique afin que le grand séminaire du Cameroun, Otélé (1949–1968), distant d'une soixantaine de kilomètres de Yaoundé, soit un observatoire pour étudier à travers la formation des futurs prêtres, le passage d'une Église missionnaire à l'émergence d'une Église ""africaine"" nationale. Ainsi, la période retenue permet de cerner la prise de distances voire des rejets avec l'héritage missionnaire qui avait reproduit un modèle occidental pour privilégier l'enracinement africain tant dans le recrutement des formateurs que par l'invention de nouvelles pastorales. Deux interrogations principales sous-tendent notre recherche. La première concerne la formation des séminaristes camerounais par des ""étrangers"", d'abord les Bénédictins (1949–1963) puis les Jésuites (1963–1968) avant que la relève ne soit assurée partiellement par des ""nationaux"". La deuxième porte sur l'acculturation. Comment les candidats au sacerdoce appréciaient-ils l'approche pédagogique, le transfert culturel, d'abord aux méthodes monacales, puis à l'esprit plus diocésain? Cette question nous a amené à traiter des difficultés d'assimilation religieuse et du clivage entre prêtres réguliers formateurs et futurs prêtres séculiers aux objectifs divergents, les premiers obéissant à la règle d'un ordre monastique et les seconds appelés à vivre en paroisse et parmi les laïcs. Dans le même temps, l'accent a été mis sur les évolutions et les changements au cours de cette période influencée par la décolonisation et l'indépendance du Cameroun, qui concernent l'ère bénédictine, et par le concile Vatican II englobant la direction jésuite, faisant émerger l'inculturation, une manière pour les séminaristes de reconquérir et réaffirmer leur identité culturelle.| |The chosen subject is situated between the religious history, the cultural and social history, studying the history of the relations and the international cultural exchanges. In our research, we suggest to make a monographic study so that the high seminary of Cameroon, Otélé (1949–1968), fur away from Yaounde by about sixty kilometres, would be an observatory to study through the vocational training of the future priests, the transition from a missionary Church to the emergence of a national ""African"" Church. So, the chosen period allows us to understand the distances, even the denials of the missionary inheritance that had recreated a western model in order to favour the African implanting, both in the recruitment of the trainers and by the invention of new pastoral theologies. Two main questionings underlie our research. The first one concerns the training of the Cameroonian seminarists by foreigners, at first the Benedictines (1949–1963), then the Jesuits (1963–1968), before it was partially insured by natives. The second one is on acculturation. How did the candidates for the priesthood appreciate the educational approach, the cultural transfer from the monastic methods to a more diocesan spirit? This question brought us to discuss on difficulties of religious assimilation and the cleavage between formatives who were regular priests and future secular priests with divergent objectives. The first ones obey the rule of a monastic order and the second ones conscript to live in parish and among the laymen. At the same time, the emphasis was put on the evolutions and the changes during this period influenced by the decolonization and the independence of Cameroon. It concerns the Benedictine era, and by the Vatican II council including the Jesuit management, which facilitated the forming of the ""inculturation"", a way for the seminarists to reconquer and reaffirm their cultural identity.",(Grenoble),,French,REVIEW

The Jesuits' strategy is traceable to Matteo Ricci's early missionary approach of accommodation to Chinese culture, which aimed to prove grounds for a Confucian-Christian synthesis based upon complementary points between Christian theology and their interpretation of Yuanru (Original Literati Teaching). Their synthesis involved both written and oral rhetorical techniques that ranged from attempts to show compatibility between different religious values, to the manipulation of texts, and to outright deceit. Personal witness, observation, and interpretation played a key role in Jesuit group translation projects. French and Chinese apologetic texts composed to prove grounds for the repeal of the 1724 proscription edict contain these approaches. The Lettres edifantes et curieuses ecrite par des missionnaires jesuites (1702–1776) contain examples of this approach, as well as the Ruijianlu (1735–1737). Memorials in the Ruijianlu cited favorable legal precedents and imperial patronage rendered to Xiyangren (Men from the West). Jesuits presented their case for toleration of Christianity in the Ruijianlu in terms of Chinese notions of hospitality, diplomacy, and defense found in texts from as early as the Zhou dynasty. They cited an enduring Chinese defensive notion of ""welcoming men from afar"" (rouyuanren), but the court refused to return to this soft policy. The Qianlong Emperor rejected the Kangxi era policy of ""welcoming men from afar"" regarding established missions. In 1735 the imperial Board of Punishments re-enforced the proscription order against Christianity in military units and also ruled that baptism of abandoned infants by a Chinese convert constituted religious heterodoxy based on the Qing Code (Article 162). The twenty-one Jesuits (not expelled in 1724) remained in imperial service and at liberty to practice their religion among themselves. Officials pursued a severe policy of punishing any cult deemed heterodox according to statutes of the Code. Persecution of Christians increased throughout the eighteenth century, but abated during the reign of the Daoguang Emperor (1821–1851) when most anti-Christian edicts were rescinded and a subsequent imperial edict pardoned those Christians who practiced the faith for moral perfection.",,,English,KEEP

The study examines the Jesuit journal La CiviltÃ  Cattolica in the period 1850–1903 as a source exemplifying the attitude of the intransigent hegemony within the Church. As a first step, aspects in the discourse of the Jesuit journal that are most constant over time are described. These are themes inherited from Catholic tradition, constructing an image of 'the Jew' that may be circulated independently of the reality of Jewish life. Secondly, the activation of this image in the journals rhetoric related to Italian unification is analyzed. The analysis reveals a strong connection between the position towards Italian nation building and the usage of anti-Jewish rhetoric. Thirdly, the research indicates that the Jesuits approaches to the 'Jewish question' and antisemitism were determined by the wish to reinforce a Catholic national identity. The study confirms that antisemitism was institutionalized within La CiviltÃ  Cattolica in the two last decades of the nineteenth century. However, the investigation adds important nuances to the prevailing ideas about the journal, by suggesting that the majority of the College did not support the anti-Jewish propaganda of the few members that most energetically wrote about Jews. The conclusions of this study point in two directions. On one side, the investigation indicates that the approach towards Italian nation building should be taken into account when studying the rhetoric concerning Jews of the Roman Catholic Church in the second half of the nineteenth century. On the other hand, it supports the thesis that the contribution of the Church towards shaping Italian national identity should be taken seriously in the studies of the Risorgimento.

The poets I have selected--Wordsworth, Coleridge, Christina Rossetti, and Gerard Manley Hopkins--variously emphasized the ethical, religious, and metaphysical consequences of readers' responses to detailed features of their poetry, from its rhythms to its material presentations. They believed that subtle dynamics in a reader's experience could reform unethical habits of sympathetic pleasure (Wordsworth); encourage or forfeit free will (Coleridge); invite participation in a communion of saints (Rossetti); or produce an intimation of divine grace (Hopkins). As a result, each was sensitive to associations that their poetry might awaken, such as the expectations excited by meter in upper middle-class readers at the turn of the century or the values attached to the sonnet by its late Victorian cultivation. Treating their poems both as authorial strategies and instances of reception, I identify overlooked connections and tensions between their aims in revising reading, the forms of their poetry, and the reading practices and responses of nineteenth-century audiences. Rather than encouraging idealistic dismissal of the contingencies of reception, I argue, these poets' attempts to influence readers' responses made them sensitive to the uncertainties and historical constraints of writing and reading, and very often confronted them with contradictions in the motives, views of reading, and beliefs that drove their writing. My approach is historical and contextual, but I reject the idea that poems are artifacts decipherable only in terms of reconstructed authorial designs, distant contexts of reception, and forgotten habits of reading. To challenge this notion, I analyze recent readings of the poems I discuss for critics' evaluative assertions and hesitations over details. In many cases, the same formal dynamics that I argue are central to a poet's strategy have provoked early and recent readers of a poem. My refusal to lock poems into contextual coffins relates to another claim: that analyzing these poets' conceptions and instigations of reading, and the results of their efforts, can aid us in reconsidering recent practices of literary criticism and pedagogy.",,,English,REVIEW

Der Mensch lebt und baut sein Leben und seine Existenz auf dem auf, was ihm die Vergangenheit gebracht hat. Gleichzeitig aber schaut der Mensch in die Zukunft und stellt die Frage, was die Zukunft ihm bringt und gibt. Der gläubige Mensch fragt gleichzeitig weiter, was ihm der Glaube für seine Zukunft bringt und was mit seinem Leben aus seiner Zeit in der Ewigkeit werden wird? Die vorliegende Arbeit will auf religionswissenschaftlicher und eschatologischer Basis die Frage nach der gegenseitigen Verankerung von Zeit und Ewigkeit klären. Im eschatologischen Bezug stehen Zeit und Ewigkeit in engem Verhältnis und dadurch findet die Zeit ihr „Größenmaß“. Daher trägt die vorliegende Arbeit den Titel „Zeit als eschatologische Größe“. Dieses Thema wird auf dem schöpferischen Grund ausgearbeitet und durch die biblische Offenbarung mit der Trinität verbunden. Darum lautet die Hauptthese dieser Arbeit: „Christliche Theologie versucht, die menschliche Zeit kairologisch und eschatologisch in die Ewigkeit des trinitarischen Gottes hinein zu verankern“. Diese Hauptthese wird erklärt und ausgelegt in fünf Teilen: Teil I: Zeit – Theorie - Darstellung bedeutsamer biblischer Zeitbegriffe. Sie zeigen: Ehe die Zeit in der Ewigkeit Gottes entgrenzt ist, ist die Ewigkeit unbegrenzte Zeit. Die unbegrenzte Zeit ist nicht leer, sondern zugleich gefüllte und erfüllte Zeit. Teil II: Zeit und Ewigkeit - Vorstellung kosmologisch-theologischer Modelle von Frank J. Tipler und Teilhard de Chardin. Christus als Alpha und Omega – der Anfang und das Ende: im Tod und in der Auferstehung, in der Wirklichkeit der Eucharistie und in der Schöpfung als die Ausdehnung der Evolution. - Verbindung der Zeit mit der Evolution durch philosophische und naturwissenschaftliche Aussagen. Die Evolution basiert auf dem Fundament der Ewigkeit Gottes und der Allgegenwart Gottes. Sie ist Fortsetzung der Schöpfung – creatio continua. Die Evolution bleibt ständig im dynamischen „nunc – jetzt“. - Darstellung der neuen Zeit-Perspektiven, welche die Ewigkeitsvorstellungen des Gregor von Nyssa eröffnen. Die Teilhabe an der Ewigkeit Gottes ist ein fortschreitender Prozess, Diastema – Schöpfungsprozess. - Die Zeit der Schöpfung findet ihre Begründung im trinitarischen Gott durch Jesus Christus als creatio ex amore. Teil III: Zeit in der symbolischen Interpretation - Verbundenheit der Symbole in der Zeit mit Ewigkeit. Symbole auf der religiösen Ebene verweisen betroffene und ergriffene Menschen auf Gottes Wirklichkeit. - Symbole in der sakramentalen Umfassung.

The human being lives and bases his life and existence on what the past has brought him. At the same time he looks to the future, and asks the question what the future will bring him. The religious person goes further, and asks what this faith will bring him for the future. And what influence his present life will have in transcendental terms. This paper will clarify the question of the mutual interconnection between Time and Eternity based on religious studies and eschatology. In the eschatological sphere, Time and Eternity stand in a very close relationship, and through this, Time gets its “magnitude”. Consequently, this paper has the title: “ Time as an eschatological Dimension”. This theme will be elaborated, based on Creation and the biblical revelation of the Trinity. The main thesis of this work is: “Christian theology, an attempts to interconnect, kariologically and eschatologically, human Time and the eternal Trinity”. This main thesis will be developed in five sections: Section I: Time – The Theory - Depiction of significant biblical time-concepts which show: Before Time was unbounded from the eternal God, eternity is unbounded Time. The unbounded Time is not an empty Time, but rather a full and fulfilled Time. Section II: Time and Eternity - A cosmological-theological Model as pictured by Frank J. Tipler and Teilhard de Chardin. Christ as Alpha and Omega – the beginning and the end: In Death and in the Resurrection, in the Reality of the Eucharist and in the Creation as an extension of Evolution. - The connection of Time and Evolution trough the evidence of philosophy and science. Evolution based on the foundation of the eternal-God and all-present-God. It is the continuation of the creation – creation continua. Evolution remains dynamically, continuously a “nunc” – “now”. - The depiction of the new Time-perspectives, as imagined and opened up by Gregory von Nyssa. The sharing in Gods eternity is a progressive process. Diastema – Process of Creation. - The time of the Creation finds its foundation in the Trinitarian God through Jesus Christ as Creation ex amore. Section III: Time in the symbolic Interpretation - Solidarity of the symbols in the Time of Eternity. Symbols on the religious level refer to Gods reality in deeply moved and affected people. - Symbols in the sacramental area: Jesus Christ as the Proto-Sacrament and at the same time that sacramental reality in which Time and Eternity are unified. Section IV: Time and Eternity in Eschatology as a Dimension of the Trinitarian God. - The ides of the theological-creation and the salvation-economical Unity of Time and Eternity in the Trinitarian reasoning from Jürgen Moltmann and Wolfhart Pannenberg. Section V: Systematic results to the theology of embedding the human Time in the Trinitarian God on a kairological and eschatological basis. - Jesus Christ, the Kairos as the bridge in Salvation History to the understanding of the Trinitarian reality of Eternity, which lives and is at work in the sacramental Church. - The Loving Community of the Three-in-one-God establishes Time in the Eternity of God.

In order to advance the Church's theological development in her search for successful interreligious dialogue with non-Christian religions and their peoples, this dissertation will argue that there is need for the Church to acknowledge that religious pluralism is not only a de facto (matter of fact) social reality but also a de jure (matter of principle) of God's relationship with the people God created. This dissertation will argue that this is an imperative theological assumption, indispensable for truly honest, lasting, respectful, and successful interreligious dialogues with peoples of non-Christian faiths. Dupuis' concept of religious pluralism, which is sensitive not only to the theological reality of God's relationship with human nature but also to the social global reality, needs appropriate media to promote and sustain the desired enduring interreligious and inter-cultural dialogue so needed and indispensable in the world today. This study will thus also propose that the appropriate means to promote such dialogue can be found in a pluralistic media culture that exhibits the dynamics articulated in Walter Ong's concept of ""dialogic openness."" It follows therefore that Ong's notion of a media society characterized by dialogic openness will provide a safe vehicle for promoting more enduring and effective interreligious dialogue based on the model of inclusive religious pluralism of Dupuis. The theological arguments of this study will be based on some relevant historical developments in the theology of universal salvation in the Catholic tradition, especially from papal documents dating from the 19th century through the Second Vatican Council and further into post Vatican II major ecclesial documents. Theological insights of several pluralist theologians will be examined to underscore the fact that Jacques Dupuis' inclusive religious pluralism did not emanate from a vacuum. Walter's Ong's dialogic openness will be examined with emphasis on his advocacy for collaboration of the different media stages of development as well as the different types of media. To accomplish the objective of this study, important parallels between Dupuis' concept of religious pluralism and Ong's notion of dialogic openness through the media in a pluralistic society will be identified. Conclusively, this study will be arguing that if a media society operates on the basis of Ong's dialogic openness, hence establishing the appropriate forums of engagement and dialogic interactions among peoples of diverse religious faith traditions and cultures based on Dupuis' inclusive religious pluralism, there is a greater likelihood for all religions in human society to collaborate effectively toward resolving many common social, economic, environmental, global, and political challenges that confront the human society today.",,,English,REVIEW

It does this by translating portions of the earliest (c. 1581) surviving presentation of Christian teachings written in Japanese, Nihon no Katekizumo (""A Catechism for Japan""). The catechism and encounter are analyzed using Michel Foucault's concept of ""episteme."" The introduction of Christianity into Japan, beginning in 1549, was a profound experience for both the Japanese people and the western missionaries. The Jesuit mission represented not only the first significant encounter with ""the West"" for the Japanese people and the first encounter with ""Japan"" for the missionaries, but it was the first significant encounter between a Christian episteme and a Japanese episteme. Nihon no Katekizumo is thought to be the oldest existing explanation of Christian doctrine in Japanese. It includes an informed critique of Japanese Buddhism and appears to have been composed by Jesuit missionaries for training Japanese students to be priests and missionaries in Japan. Analysis of the form and content of Nihon no Katekizumo suggests that the text was intended to persuade Japanese novices of not only the truth of Christian teachings, but also their superiority to Buddhist teachings. It provides criticism of Japanese religious teachings and an explanation of Christian doctrine. The use of many classical Chinese characters and technical Buddhist terms clearly suggests that Nihon no Katekizumo was prepared with an elite, Buddhist audience in mind. By translating and examining extant sections of Nihon no Katekizumo (the preface and the first chapter), this thesis discusses the episteme held by the Jesuit missionaries and how it functioned in their Japanese mission. Further, this thesis investigates how the Jesuits' use of the Japanese language to argue and assert their own episteme necessarily resulted in an encounter with another, Japanese Buddhist episteme, a kind of interaction that Foucault himself did not discuss in his writings.",,,English,REVIEW

Lonergan's methodological framework, which he called functional specialization, provides a generic differentiation of tasks, each of which is central to the overall project of understanding religious diversity. This thesis explores the relevance and utility of functional specialization as a methodological approach to religious diversity in the philosophy of religion. The first chapter is an analysis of the literature on religious diversity as a topic in the philosophy of religion. It unearths the dominant concerns in the field and some of the obstacles which continue to hinder the development of this enquiry. The second chapter provides the epistemological grounds of functional specialization. While the division of tasks outlined by Lonergan's methodology is useful simply insofar as it differentiates the tasks of academic enquiry, there are more theoretical grounds by which this division is justified. The third chapter provides an explanatory account of the operations and tasks involved in each of the eight functional specialties. It elucidates these specialties by drawing upon relevant analogies from outside the field of religious studies. The fourth chapter brings together the two main concerns of the study by suggesting ways in which functional specialization can make a methodological contribution to the enquiry into religious diversity. It organizes the distinct but related tasks which constitute the philosophical study of religious diversity, demonstrates the current trends regarding each of these tasks, and suggests ways in which they can be made more effective. Lonergan's notion of functional specialization makes an important contribution to the philosophical debate over religious diversity in significant ways. It provides an effective methodology which delineates both the fundamental tasks of scholarly enquiry and the operations involved in these tasks. It explains how current work in the philosophy of religious diversity could benefit from a clear delineation of the relevant tasks. It provides a framework which is open to collaboration among scholars of diverse philosophical and theological viewpoints.",,,English,REVIEW

It includes a brief analysis of how high school faculty and administrators can work collaboratively with parents in fostering the moral formation of youth. This study is significant and unique in four ways. First, no other research study offers a fully-developed character education approach and framework for Christian, Catholic religious education. Second, this study highlights what is often left out of the field of Religious Educationnamely the moral formation of our students. Third, the contemporary character education movement focuses primarily on public elementary and middle school education. This study looks at character formation as it occurs in secondary schooling. Most significantly, this study brings the best elements of character education to Jesuit pedagogy, and outlines an approach for cultivating character in Jesuit high schools as part of a comprehensive approach to Catholic religious education. This study is a humanistic, and in particular a Christian humanistic, and historical study that is informed by contemporary scholarship in history, theology, ethics, education and religious education. It provides an overview of the relevant literature on character and character education, with interpretation, analysis, and a critique from a religious educational perspective. The study also provides an overview of the history of character education in Christian religious education. It demonstrates that while academic excellence is an important goal for Jesuit secondary schools, greater attention can and should be focused, in accord with the principles of Jesuit education, on the development of character in order to produce well-rounded persons.",,,English,KEEP

Marcelino García, S.J. has been the president of Belen Jesuit Preparatory School for 25 years. The longevity and success of his tenure is an exemplary case of effective leadership and provided significant insight into what constitutes effective school leadership. The target population for this case study consisted of the school’s 7 administrators, 90 faculty members, 10 English-speaking staff members, and 3 key informants. Data were collected using Bolman and Deal’s (1997) Leadership Orientation Survey along with the Jesuit Secondary Education Administration’s (1994) Administrative Leadership Profile Survey (ALPS). Data collected from the surveys were analyzed using the SPSS, version 10. The study also included data collected from focus interviews with Fr. García and six other significant members of the school community. The interviews were approximately 1–hour individual interviews that employed a semi-structured guide. A concurrent triangulation method was used that directly compared the results from these data collection methods. This was done by looking at the data as a whole and in parts. The parts were internal (faculty, administrators, and staff) and external (parents, alumni, and the superior of the Jesuit community) sectors. The comparison of the findings was then examined in terms of each research question. Analysis of the data revealed that while Fr. García’s predominant leadership style reflected the typical Bolman and Deal characteristics associated with the political frame, his leadership demonstrates access to all four frames. Research has found a correlation between multiple frame use and successful leadership. Relatedly, Fr. García’s capacity to approach his administration from various perspectives is indicative of success. In addition, from the perspective of Jesuit education, an analysis of Fr. García’s leadership indicated recurring themes that contributed to the school’s organizational health. The results of this study provide an extensive analysis of the administration of a unique leader. An analysis of Fr. García’s leadership style from two perspectives gives fresh insight into sustained and successful leadership.",,,English,KEEP

Les représentants en sont le Père Louis Le Comte et des autres premiers Jésuites en Chine; la deuxième période montre une certaine acceptation de l'art chinois. Les présentions des Jésuites, bien que neutres, ouvrent la voie en Europe à une vague orientaliste. Le Frère Attiret est le représentant de cette période. Dès la publication de sa lettre en 1749, l'Europe pose son regard sur le jardin chinois, particulièrement à travers Yuan ming yuan. Cette lettre contribue alors à la création des parcs ""imités de la Chine"" à travers toute l'Europe; la troisième période est caractérisée par les ouvrages des jésuites dont le séjour en Chine s'étend à la deuxième moitié du XVIIIe siècle, surtout de ceux qui ont réalisé les ""Mémoires concernant des Chinois"".

Since the end of the 17th century, the detailed reports from the Jesuits living in China allowed the introduction of Chinese art into Europe, in a more complete and precise way. We can divide this introduction into three chronological periods: The first one is a period of reject, of misunderstanding due to the superficiality of the sketches about Chinese architecture, represented by Father Louis Le Comte and other first Jesuits in China. The second period shows, to certain extend a better acceptation of Chinese architecture. The presentations done by the Jesuits, although neutral, open the way to an orientalistic wave in Europe. Father Attiret is representative of this period. As soon as his letter is published, in 1747, Europe's interest grows on Chinese gardens, particularly Yuan Ming Yuan. His letter contributes then to the creation of parks and gardens ""in the Chinese way"" all over Europe. The third period is characterized by the works of Jesuits who stayed in China as long as the second part of the 18th century, mainly those who contributed to the ""Mémoires concernant des chinois"". Father Cibot is the most brilliant author about architecture, with his theory on the Chinese garden. His translation of a poem by Sima Guang shows the manner used by lettered Chinese people to create their own gardens, while deepens the European people's approach to the subject.",,,French,REVIEW

Como os jesuítas já recolhiam estudantes antes de vir para o Brasil, resolvemos panoramicamente saber como isso se dava. Denominaremos recolhimento dos meninos o dispositivo que materializou a prática educativa, própria do Ocidente. Tal dispositivo, retira esta tese do passado e a lança como problematizadora do presente, pois recolher e entregar são mais do que simples palavras, são discursos que ajudaram a construir, nesse caso, uma certa ordem pedagógica. Sobre isso, Foucault nos orienta. Afinal, por que razão, em meio a tantos descasos, entregamos e recolhemos as crianças às escolas? Sem meta explícita, esta tese acabou por questionar a noção de recolhimento como a primeira etapa da educação no Brasil. Porém, num exame mais apurado, descobrimos que o recolhimento é muito mais um dispositivo, uma prática, do que uma instituição em si. Se a escolarização brasileira só vai ganhar força no século XX, parece-nos, que o recolhimento foi uma prática que cotejou os primeiros anos desse século, fazendo, por exemplo, professores irem até as fazendas levantar o censo dos meninos para abrir escolas públicas. O recolhimento é a base discursiva da ordem pedagógica que atravessou a colônia brasileira e, quiçá, mesmo abandonado nos dias de hoje, ainda é utilizado pelos profissionais da área de educação, servindo, inclusive, como justificativa para barganhar as verbas públicas.||Its necessary to gain and retire the heathens sons: its a Jesuit axiom.

Jesuits had already retired students before coming to Brazil, therefore we have decided to know it happened, why this became a western educational practice, removing this thesis from the past and throwing it to the present, because to retire and to give are move than simple words: they are speeches that have helped to set a pedagogical order up. On this we have Foucault guidance. After all, why we give and retire children to the schools? Without an explicit goal, this thesis has come to question the notion of retiring as the first stage of the education in Brazil. Yet, through a more refined analysis, we have found out that retiring is much more a device, a practice, than an institution.

F., 1904–1984","This dissertation explores Bernard Lonergan's notion of emergent probability as a world process which explains the intelligibility of natural evolution, human history and the human cognitional structure. It is the immanent intelligibility of the order in which ideas, insights, bias, events, things, schemes, institutions, nations exist or occur, reoccur, survive or seize to reoccur. Therefore, it is a worldview that envisions conditioned series of schemes of recurrences, their progressive, decline, reversal and defensive cycles, and their respective possibilities, probabilities, and actualities of emergence and survival.|The focus of this dissertation is not on emergent probability in nature, but on that of human cooperation based on conditioned series of schemes of recurrence of insight and bias with respect to the levels of operations. Just as human beings have a desire to know, they also have a desire to make, to create, to invent, to innovate and remake, re-create, reinvent, re-innovate tools, thereby accumulating insights and establishing higher viewpoints for further knowing, making and remaking. This desire to make and the pattern of technological experience presupposes the levels of operations: technology, economy, society, politics, and religion. These levels are interlocked in a complementary and interdependent operative scheme.|Man is most fundamentally technological. Technology is the first level of operations, a good of order, and the texture of civilization that clearly depict the recurrent schemes of human direct and inverse insights in relation to progress; dramatic, individual, group and general biases, and perverse inverse insight in relation to decline. Inasmuch as insight leads to the propagation of one wheel of progress, it also devises the defensive cycles that sustain its existence, through falsification of history, rationalization of sin and initiation of the “order of evil” and social surd.|In this dissertation, computer information system is a key illustration of Lonergan's notion of emergent probability. If information is a component of emergent probability, then information systems should aim at the actualization of insight as information. The emergence of information systems suggests the possibility of thinking machines, given that what is possible may become probable, and what is probable soon or later becomes actual. The assumption that thinking machines are actual and information as insight is not a bias may lead to the emergence of the algorithmic human being- a human being exiled from the orbits of authentic cognitional process. Insight is primary in the sustainability of self-corrective process of human cooperation and the creative integration of the levels of operations.|A possible implementation of an understanding of general notion of emergent probability and the primacy of insight as information can illuminate an understanding of the historical processes of the wheel of progress and defensive cycles operative in the African context. The good of order and the order of evil are initiated by power, liberty, insight or bias and the alteration of the first level of operation and the subsequent conditioned series of schemes of recurrence of human operations and cooperation. Hence, creative appropriation and technological liberation, and cosmopolis constitute a viable solution to the development of Dynamic System Of Integrity and Authentication for understanding African history. Authentic development, the good of order without an accompanying order of evil within the worldview of emergent probability is not possible without the transcendental precepts of being attentive, being intelligent, being reasonable and being responsible. Again development is not possible without cosmopolis empowered by the theological virtues as the way to overcoming the problem of practicality of the common sense. And also, the infusion of God's habitual grace in the human statistical laws shifts the probabilities of emergence of the levels of operations. The God presupposed by emergent probability becomes a solution to the problem of evil, the order of evil and social surd. Given that no nation, people or country can develop or grow under the exploitation of its enemies and friends, therefore Africa's development and growth cannot be achieved without conversion to the understanding of things as recurrent, without authentic actualization of insight as information and the redirection of education systems to reflect the technological process, the political will for its adaptation and its defense.",,,English,REVIEW

F., 1904–1984","It has been long known that groups of adults learn and enact their learning in certain ways; what is little known is how groups learn and how they develop in cognitive complexity. This dissertation proposes a theory of group cognitive development by arguing that intentional adult groups are complex and dynamic, and that they have the potential to evolve over time. Groups are complex in that they are made up of individuals within different orders of consciousness (Kegan), and they are dynamic in that different orders of consciousness interact and conflict (Lonergan) during the formation and enactment of group vision, values, and procedures. Dynamic complexity theory of group development as it is referred to in this study is grounded in Robert Kegan's constructive developmental theory and in Bernard Lonergan's transcendental method. While both Kegan and Lonergan attend to the growth of individuals, their theories are adapted to groups in order to understand the cognitive complexity of groups, intragroup and intergroup conflict, and the mental complexity of leader curriculum. This theory is applied to two case studies, one from antiquity in the case of the first century Corinthian community engaged in conflict with its founder, St. Paul, and in one contemporary study of American Catholic parishioners engaged in contentious dialogue with diocesan leaders from 1994 to 2004. The parish groups experienced a series of dialogues during a ten year period over the issues of parish restructuring and the priest sexual abuse crisis yielding cumulative and progressive changes in perspective-taking, responsibility-taking, and in group capacity to respond to and engage local and institutional authority figures. Group development is observed against a pedagogical backdrop that represents a mismatch between group complexity and leader expectations. In Corinth, Paul's curriculum was significantly beyond the mental capacity of the community. In the case of Catholic parishioners the ...",,,English,REVIEW

F., 1904–1984","This dissertation articulates a critical social theory that is sympathetic to the emancipatory project of modernity. It argues that Western rationality should not be overcome but be rehabilitated, that modernism should not be abandoned but be redeemed, that the isolated, self-centered, disembodied Cartesian cogito should be rejected to allow the emergence of a decentered self, and that the objectified world of science should be repudiated to realize a lifeworld that is constituted by common meaning. It sees the possibility of completing the unfinished project of human liberation through a systematic retrieval and reformulation of the conceptual foundations of modernity, namely, selfhood, rationality, and society, which will form the bases for a radical critique and overcoming of the phenomena of alienation, domination, and colonization in late capitalism.|Lonergan and Habermas use two different paradigms in dealing with modernism. I argue that Habermas's paradigm of communicative action, which he develops from his critique and rejection of the philosophy of the subject, is based on a wrong understanding of the concept of consciousness as necessarily implying instrumentalism. This basic paradigmatic problem in Habermas leads to a neglect of the individual self, a one-sided conception of reason as merely linguistically constituted, and an excessively linguistic concept of the lifeworld that ignores the non-linguistic elements of social life. By complementing Habermas's communicative approach with Lonergan's paradigm of self-appropriation, we can recover a more comprehensive concept of selfhood that is embodied, situated, communicative, intersubjective, free, critical, responsible, and responsive to the transcendental precepts and validity claims. The Lonerganian reconstruction of Habermas's communicative rationality also leads to the recovery of reason that is both cognitively and linguistically constituted, critical, evidential, emancipatory, attentive, intelligent, reasonable, and responsible. Our reconstructive project also gives way to a concept of lifeworld that is both linguistic and perceptual.|The convergence of the two paradigms--communication and self-appropriation--is a new approach to modernity which we call ""new modernism."" The concept of ""new modernism"" shows that the emancipatory project of modernity can be completed through self-appropriation of the different levels of one's conscious intentionality in order to give way to a cognitive, communicative praxis that leads to truth, freedom, and justice. This process demands a further enlightenment, or what Lonergan calls Second Enlightenment, geared towards the restoration of meaning, empowerment, and emancipation through intellectual, moral, and affective conversion.",,,English,REVIEW

The traits of love illustrated in the first part of the encyclical have been developed within a model of education enriched by the contributions of contemporary scholars as Bernard Lonergan (philosophy of education), Martin D'Arcy (anthropology), Paulo Freire (political education), Avery Dulles (theology) and Franco Imoda (psychology). Benedict XVI's notion of love-caritas-agape draws together significant themes of Ratzinger's thought (communio, faith-reason, ethics of witnesses, etc.) and is developed in his further papal teaching. According to Benedict XVI, love can be an essential animating force of Catholic education within the nature and mission of the Church; it is a form of evangelization, an authentic answer to the current educational emergency. ^ Moreover, Catholic education is a Church work of charity and mercy. According to Benedict XVI, this emphasis on love and its educational consequences should make the development Catholic education a priority for the pastoral programs of bishops and for the agenda of international leaders.|The findings of 'elite interviews' to international leaders of Catholic education completed this investigation revealing a generic perception of the potentiality of Benedict XVI's teaching about love as well as of the way he is challenging Catholic institutions to answer the current educational emergency. ^ International leaders of Catholic education are open to discuss these issues (because of their loyalty to the Church as institution), even if they show a general perception of how Benedict XVI's emphasis on love could challenge Catholic education. ^",,,English,REVIEW

One of theology's most important functions is to furnish people with ways of perceiving these divine intimations in their concrete lives and relationships. Orientation to transcendental mystery is the sine qua non for initiation into faith. Theology must therefore lead people more deeply into the mystery of everyday existence as a preparation for the Christian life. At the same time, theology aims at expounding Christian teaching in as clear and intelligible a manner as possible. Theology accomplishes this by adapting its modes of presenting doctrine to the needs and capabilities of its addressees. This two-fold responsibility is properly understood as theology's mystagogical task. This dissertation argues that film is a crucial reference point for mystagogy--a locus mystagogicus. Film interprets human experience in ways conceptual theology cannot. It is thus a rich source for theological reflection. Theology is also an indispensable resource for film interpretation and a natural dialogue partner since it seeks to disclose the deepest dimensions of existence. More importantly, film needs theology as the hermeneutic that formally interprets religious experience--something that many human beings only vaguely sense, often misunderstand, and can easily misrepresent. With the help of film experts, theology can turn its discerning eyes to the stories and images of film and present viewers with a unique language by which they can articulate a response to their film experience. Film thus requires theology to bear witness to its artistry when it does succeed in opening people in wonder and humility to the ever-greater God. This dissertation in Catholic systematic theology investigates the theoretical and practical conditions of possibility for film as a locus for and of mystagogy. The question that it attempts to clarify is the extent to which Karl Rahner's fundamental theology provides an apposite and needed model for the way Catholic theology relates to film. There are three basic goals: (1) to outline existing ecclesial and theological foundations for a Catholic theology of film by way of a survey of magisterial documents on cinema and the writings of individual Catholic theologians and film scholars; (2) to provide greater theological grounding for Catholic approaches to film by developing the model that film is a locus mystagogicus on the basis of Rahner's transcendental method, creative retrieval of ancient mystagogy, and theological aesthetics; and (3) to test the viability and vitality of this model by way of analysis of the film Babette's Feast.",,,English,KEEP

In the Pampas, the Spaniards did not encounter large, farming Indian populations like those of central Mexico or the Andean highlands, but mobile hunter-gatherers whom they were unable to conquer and subdue. Using an ethnohistorical approach, this dissertation shows that although Indians remained independent, they thoroughly reinvented their societies under the multidimensional impact of the Spanish arrival, which included ecological changes, epidemics, slaving raids, and intercultural commerce. Most dramatically, the Pampa Indians became superb horse-riders, deft hunters of (feral) cattle, avid consumers of Spanish manufactures, and an integral part of long-distance exchange networks that extended west across the Andes and reached into southern Chile. On the basis of this ethnohistorical understanding of the Pampas, this dissertation offers an ambitious reconsideration of Buenos Aires' early colonial period. The intersection of Andean and Atlantic trade circuits in Buenos Aires during the seventeenth century provided the stimuli for the development of cattle ranching as a main local economic activity. Spanish settlers adapted Iberian cattle-ranching practices to the challenges and opportunities of the Pampas by developing a hunting industry to exploit the proliferating herds of feral livestock that roamed the plains. Such hunting industry put the Spaniards in direct contact, and competition, with the Indians who inhabited the Pampas and with the Indians who arrived seasonally from the Andean zone to hunt and trade. The dissertation examines the complex intercultural and intertribal relations that ensued, which included Indian raids, military expeditions, diplomatic negotiations and treaties, and short-lived Jesuit missions. By the 1750s, these relations had resulted in the emergence of a militarized frontier line lying barely a hundred miles southwest of Buenos Aires. This frontier line defined intercultural relations in the Pampas for the next hundred years, and became a fundamental element in the narrative of Argentina's emergence as a modern nation in the early twentieth century.",,,English,REVIEW

The inspiration for this project often came from mathematics in general and from geometry in particular: Just as propositions were ordered in a geometrical demonstration, the argument went, so should propositions be ordered in an overall system of knowledge. Science, it was thought, had to proceed `more geometrico'. I offer a new interpretation of `science emph{more geometrico}' based on an analysis of the explanatory forms used in certain branches of geometry. These branches were optics, astronomy, and mechanics; the so-called subalternate, subordinate, or mixed-mathematical sciences. In Part I, I investigate the nature of the mixed-mathematical sciences according to Aristotle and some `liberal Jesuit' scholastic-Aristotelians. In Part II, the heart of the work, I analyze the metaphysics and physics of Descartes' ""Principles of Philosophy"" (1644, 1647) in light of the findings of Part I and an example from Galileo. I conclude by arguing that we must broaden our understanding of the early modern conception of `science more geometrico' to include concepts taken from the mixed-mathematical sciences. These render the geometrical manner more flexible than previously thought.",,,English,REVIEW

F., 1904–1984","A wealth of recent scholarship has focused on interreligious dialogue as a resource for the transformation of religious conflicts. Such studies often mention the importance of discoveries or 'insights' as key factors in successful dialogue processes. However, few authors have devoted sustained attention to understanding how insights contribute to transforming conflict dynamics during interfaith dialogues. The present study draws on the cognitional theory of Canadian philosopher Bernard Lonergan as a framework for exploring the significance of insights in interreligious dialogue processes. The study begins with an overview of representative perspectives on learning in interfaith dialogue and conflict transformation. Following this, I offer a detailed analysis of Lonergan's work on insight in understanding, judgment, and practical learning, highlighting the important role that insights play in structuring interpretation and communication in dialogue situations. Drawing on Lonergan's theoretical framework, I explore how insights are implicated in shaping communication in dialogues between religious actors, both in the development of conflicts, as well as in their transformation. Using case studies from dialogues involving Christians, Muslims, and Jews, I examine how mistaken insights can contribute to sustaining relationships of threat among parties in religious conflicts. I then examine how dialogue processes can act as catalysts for the emergence of new and more accurate insights that transform parties' understanding of the conflict. By helping parties correct mistaken interpretations and discover alternate ways of communicating, such insights can often play an important role in facilitating shifts from hostile patterns of interaction to more cooperative forms of engagement. Throughout, I explain how Lonergan's work offers significant advances over existing discussions of insight and its role in conflict transformation processes. His approach identifies a range of different types of insights, and thus facilitates an analysis of the different roles insights can play in structuring communication at different phases of dialogue processes. It also permits a more developed exploration of the various cognitional and environmental conditions that facilitate or frustrate the occurrence of insights in dialogue situations. His work thus constitutes an important resource for theorists and practitioners seeking a better understanding of the cognitive dynamics that contribute to the transformation of interreligious dialogue processes.",,,English,REVIEW

The emblem form has been considered from the perspective of individual author, geographical factors and theological background but there have been few comparative studies with respect to religious emblems. This study will compare Protestant and Catholic emblems produced during the Reformation and Counter- Reformation, drawing on specific examples from, in particular, France, but also Germany and England. Emblems played a huge role in early modern life. They expressed contemporary thought and also became part of the physical environment, being etched into stone, or wood, or sewn into cloth as decoration. In a period of such political, civil, and religious unrest, it would, therefore, seem likely that the Catholic and Protestant emblem would be quite distinct types either expressing theologically opposed notions, or manipulating the text/image relationship in quite different ways. Understanding how these emblems functioned, therefore, necessitates close reading, indeed, reading in the way the emblems were intended to be read. This study, therefore, will address the question of differences through detailed analysis of specific examples. This study begins with an introduction which gives a brief history of emblem literature and a review of relevant secondary material. Key terms and definitions regarding emblems are also explained here. This chapter also introduces the authors of the emblems analysed in later chapters. The first part of this thesis examines the emblem form in the wider context of the Reformation. From an initial overview of some of the key issues of the Reformation in chapter one, chapters two and three move on to analyse closely a wide corpus of Catholic and Protestant emblems. In these chapters the emblem is broken down into its component parts of verse and picture. Chapter two examines the religious emblem from the perspective of motif while chapter three approaches the emblem from a thematic angle. The second part of this study adopts a different approach presenting case studies of three authors. Chapter four explores the importance of the visual element in the emblems of Protestant author Rollenhagen. Chapter five investigates the Jesuit influences which shape the emblems of Catholic Berthod. While chapters four and five offer an insight into the work of prototypical Protestant and Catholic authors chapter six demonstrates the successful fusion of both Protestant and Catholic influences in the emblems of Wither. Indeed, this study suggests that the differences between Protestant and Catholic at this time are largely exaggerated with respect to emblems. Protestant and Catholic emblems are not, this study maintains, in essence all that different. It argues that, in fact, Protestant and Catholic emblems were often very close in terms of content and that the real difference is in the way they manipulate the text/image relationship.",,,English,REVIEW

Com ênfase no estudo das escolhas técnicas inseridas na cadeia operatória de confecção dos artefatos cerâmicos, buscou-se perceber as permanências e as mudanças técnicas ocorridas a partir do contato nas diferentes etapas de sua confecção em relação a: a aquisição da argila, tratamento da pasta, técnicas de confecção, forma do artefato, acabamento de superfície e queima, quando as vasilhas estão prontas ao uso. Foram analisadas as coleções cerâmicas do sítio Ibm 4 Pedra Grande, onde se instalou a Redução, em comparação com os vasilhames do sítio Ibm 14 Rodolfo Mariano pertencentes a um contexto funerário datado do século XI da nossa era. A percepção da continuidade e da mudança técnica se deu pelas recorrências e variabilidades na cultura material, percebidas através de atributos técnicos aplicados a cada fragmento de artefato e com auxílio de análises de Microscopia Óptica, Fluorescência de Raios X e Difratometria de Raios X. Dessa forma, buscou-se compreender quais mudanças técnicas ocorreram inseridas num conjunto maior de transformações de todos os aspectos da cultura dentro de uma totalidade social. No momento do contato com os europeus, os Guarani se deparam com uma nova situação diferente da tradicional, em que novos artefatos e conhecimentos técnicos lhe são apresentados. Percebeu-se que dentro destas possibilidades de mudanças, os Guarani optaram por adotar algumas características técnicas novas e rejeitar outras, produzindo algumas mudanças técnicas perceptíveis no estudo da cultura material, e é sobre esse processo que procurou-se refletir na finalização do trabalho.||This work aimed at finding out how the occupation of Pedra Grande site, located at the central region of Rio Grande do Sul state, as well its surroundings, by the Guarani people, happened since the beginning of the settlement until the moment of first contact, when they were inserted into a Jesuit-Guarani settlement in the beginning of the XVII century. Focusing on the technological choices inserted in the Operation Sequence of ceramic artifact confection, one tried to notice the permanent or changed technological choices occurred from the first contact throughout the different stages of its confection considering: clay acquisition, paste treatment, techniques of manufacture, artifact forming and shaping, surface finishing, and firing, and vessels ready to be used. One analyzed the pottery collection of: Ibm 4 Pedra Grande site, where the settlement got place, in comparison to the vessels of Ibm 14 Rodolfo Mariano site that consists of a funerary context dated from the XI century from our era. The technological continuity and changing perception was possible due to the recurrence and variability on the material culture, noticed through technological attributes applied on each artifact fragment, assisted by Optical Microscopy, X Ray Fluorescence (XRF) and also X Ray Diffractometry. In this way, one searched about what technological changes occurred inserted into a bigger group of cultural transformations in a social totality. When in contact with Europeans, the Guarani people face a new situation if compared to the traditional one, in which new artifacts as well as technological knowledge are presented to them. It was noticed that among those possible changes, the Guarani people opted by adopting some of the new techniques but rejecting others, producing some of the technological changes noticed on the material culture study, which guided the final reflection in this work.",,,Portuguese,REVIEW

He wrote a treatise for non-believers hoping to communicate to them the concepts of the Christian God as the great parent (the dafumu) and of humankind as God's children. Wang also established a charitable society to implement his religious thought in social action. However, recent research on Wang Zheng is incomplete, and does not reflect his importance both in Chinese Church history and in the dialogue between Chinese and Christian cultures. This thesis, taking the perspective of inculturation, offers a comprehensive study of Wang Zheng's life, his religious thought, and how they related to one another. It reconstructs Wang Zheng's attempt to persuade others by arguing from the intellectual, religious, and social contexts in his trilogy, Xueyoung shujie, Weitian airen jilun and Renhuiyue, that Tianzhu (God) as Creator was the great parent (the dafumu) who gave life to humankind who, as children of Tianzhu, should respond to Him with filial piety or xiao. The thesis also delineates the content of Wang Zheng's theology of xiao, which is informed by the spirit of fearing Tianzhu and loving others (weitian airen). Accordingly, to practise one's xiao to Tianzhu, one should return to Tianzhu, observe the Ten Commandments or tianming, and participate in relief for the poor. Since Wang Zheng's inculturation was not widely recognised by Jesuit missionaries and the Chinese Christian community, therefore its impact on both local culture and the wider Christian community was not fully realised. This thesis completes the process of inculturation by articulating its possible contributions to future dialogue between these two traditions.",,,English,REVIEW

His method, founded on the concrete subject seeking the good offers a creative framework which validates women's abortion decision-making and acting, as an important source of moral data. The transcendental method consists of the four operations of consciousness: experience, understanding, judging and deciding which operate within each individual. The thesis consists of four chapters each focusing on one of the operations in relation to abortion. I use Daniel Maguire's eight ""reality revealing"" questions and Lonergan's notions of horizon and social structures in order to reach a deeper understanding of voluntary pregnancy interruption. There are several social structures which require abortion as act of meaning if they are to function effectively. An analysis of the ""good"" of abortion consists of Lonergan's explanation of the human good; its components, the scale of values, and the three levels of the good. In the conclusion concrete actions are suggested as the result of my tentative reconstruction of a world of meaning in which social and cultural values (the good) are incarnated by individual women voluntarily ending their pregnancy.

In this study, adult learning methods such as experiential activities, discussion, teamwork, and action learning were used in a seven-week online MBA course to explore in what ways intercultural sensitivity could be developed. A two-trial, pretest-posttest research mixed methods design was implemented in the summers of 2004 and 2005 at a Midwestern Jesuit university. Quantitative and qualitative data were gathered and analyzed from thirty-eight participants (N=38). First, quantitative analysis of pretest-posttest scores from the Intercultural Development Inventory (IDI) (Hammer and Bennett, 1998, 2002, 2004), and demographic variables, revealed that sixty-eight percent (68%) of participants developed greater intercultural sensitivity while age, gender, and degrees of course engagement were predictors of IDI score change. Second, qualitative analysis of survey data found that the quality of virtual teamwork impacted perceived learning outcomes and most participants found the online MBA course to be a useful and complementary addition to ""traditional"" MBA face-to-face courses. Finally, six case studies were developed to explore IDI stage shift and construct explanatory schemas. Conclusions suggest that coping strategies, cooperative/collaborative efforts, flexible cognitive orientations, course engagement, introspective reflection, and cultural curiosity were factors that impacted intercultural sensitivity development. The results of the study confirm that intercultural sensitivity can be learned and measured using an online delivery format and the IDI. Recommendations to further develop this online MBA course include: 1) expand length of course, 2) incorporate role of intercultural coach, 3) include synchronous components, 4) provide clearer course expectations, 5) structure purposeful teams, and 6) enrich course content. Four directions for future research that emerged from the study include testing course effectiveness using larger graduate student samples, examining the effects of different team composition on intercultural sensitivity development, comparing a blended learning environment with purely online delivery, and conducting longitudinal studies to measure behavioral change.",,,English,REVIEW

In terms of atonement theologies, this dissonance has been interpreted through the development of a converted sense of beauty in which the cross, as perceived and interpreted by the believer in the context of faith, expands Christian aesthetics. One of the more prominent examples of this construction can be found in the theology of Hans Urs von Balthasar, wherein divine beauty culminates in Christ's kenotic self-surrender at the cross. In a feminist hermeneutic, the identification of divine beauty with crucified love is dangerous, as it runs the risk of glorifying suffering and self-sacrifice. This dissertation brings a feminist hermeneutic to bear upon the way in which the beauty of the cross patterns right relations and the praxis of faith in Balthasar's theological aesthetics and dramatics. I argue that this construction of aesthetics, when paired with the gender symbolism and violence implicit in Balthasar's dramatic narrative of redemption, mutes the embodied subjectivity of women by sanctifying the wounds of violence and eclipsing human possibilities for wholeness. Drawing upon the soteriological contributions of feminist and womanist theologians, I argue that beauty must stake a claim in human flourishing, in particular the spiritual and material well-being of women.

The first, documentary/historical phase of the study examined the spirituality background to retreats within Catholicism which informed the conduct of school retreats. While not attempting an exhaustive or comprehensive analysis of spirituality, this section identified the roots of 'retreat spirituality' in developments within early Christianity such as 'desert spirituality', in the spirituality of mediaeval monasticism, and in the 'religious exercises' of the active religious orders that emerged since the founding of the Jesuits in the early 16th century. Elements such as 'going away' to an isolated place, solitude, silence, reflection and prayer, review of one's life, physical and mental renewal, and spiritual guidance became prominent in the development of retreats for religious personnel and clergy; and this served as the model that informed 'silent' retreats in Catholic schools up to and including the 1960s.

F., 1904–1984","Bernard Lonergan's understanding of the developing subject is conceived concretely in terms of the broadening horizon of the subject towards a real apprehension of the human good, from particular good to the notion of value. I will argue that Lonergan's understanding of the developing subject is a complex phenomenon rooted in the self-transcending existential subject's freedom and apprehension of value, which precedes decision-making and which orients the course of one's personal development. An analysis of Bernard Lonergan's understanding of the development of the subject reveals that he drew heavily from the psychologist Abraham Maslow. My main purpose is to retrieve Lonergan's insights on personal development by comparing to what extent his thinking is similar to and different from that of Maslow's. I will argue that although there are similarities in their thought, the perspectives they offer regarding human nature are reached from within very different horizons, and therefore their understanding of personal development, although complimentary, is foundationally different. In the final chapter I offer suggestions for merging the two thinkers' thought in order to provide a more complete understanding of personal development which takes seriously considerations from both psychology and theology.",,,English,REVIEW

Drawing on currents in cultural anthropological thought about the complex relationship between anthropologists, their subjects, and the texts they produce, I analyze how the Relations allowed Jesuit missionaries to define for French readers Amerindian cultures, European-Amerindian interactions, and the health and success of the colony and the mission for forty years, almost without competition, giving them extraordinary influence over perceptions of the Amerindian Other at the very moment that France's interest therein was being piqued by an increasing awareness of the world outside of Europe. The texts now are lauded as the premiÃ¨re source of information on the Algonquian and Iroquoian groups with which the Jesuits were in contact in seventeenth century New France. In this dissertation, I examine the ways Jesuits conveyed information about Amerindian groups, focusing on the rhetorical aspects of their accounts that have been largely ignored by social scientists who have mined the texts for data. Instead of considering the Relations as a collection of facts recorded by diligent field workers, I seek to understand them as texts that reflect multiple points of view and the political, religious, and intellectual pressures acting on their French Catholic authors. Were Amerindians human? If so, were they created in Eden along with the ancestors of Europeans? How could one explain their presence in America, with little apparent knowledge of their origins? And if they were human and of the same stock as European Christians, how could one explain the fact that their beliefs and behavior were so different from those of their French Christian interlocutors? These questions, I argue, left an enduring mark on the Jesuits' descriptions of Amerindian cult Dissertation",,,English,KEEP

To achieve this purpose a qualitative, exploratory case study was used to examine a student affairs division at Western Jesuit University (pseudonym), an urban university in the Western United States. Data was collected through 18 in-depth interviews of transfer students of color and student affairs administrators and staff of diverse racial backgrounds in February and March, 2009. Protocols for interviews, document analysis, and observations were created by the researcher based on a theoretical framework developed from recommendations for transforming student affairs practice by Patton, McEwen, Rendon, and Howard-Hamilton (2007). The central question addressed in this study was ""What levels of awareness do student affairs administrators and staff have regarding the influence of whiteness as an individual and systemic presence in student affairs in a predominantly white Catholic Jesuit university?"" Related research questions addressed the characteristics of the interactions of student affairs administrators and staff with transfer students of color and the organizational and social factors that impacted their awareness of whiteness. Findings from responses to the research questions revealed that awareness of participants of whiteness is embedded with assumptions about difference and that bias in the classroom is a concern for students and administrators and staff. Additionally, findings revealed that notions of an ideal ""typical"" student exist. Finally, analyses also revealed that validation of identity, representativeness, overall campus climate and co-optation, as a way to contain difference, were important issues. Recommendations are that the leadership of Western Jesuit University and the student affairs division develop a critical activist approach in assessing current practices and policies and how whiteness and assumptions of difference may be embedded in them. Additionally, leadership must develop policies and practices that support a liberatory consciousness, difference, and social justice in an equitable and comprehensive way.",,,English,KEEP

I argue that globalization and modernization trends---set in motion by Spain's eighteenth century efforts to reinvigorate its crumbling empire---doomed the missions to failure irrespective of the Jesuit expulsion. On the one hand, foreign trade expansion, regional economic growth, and political reforms intensified competition over mission resources and created new opportunities for the Guarani outside of the missions. On the other hand, the Crown's efforts to exert control over the missions and advance the Guaranies' temporal well-being worsened living conditions inside the missions. As a result, the Guarani disengaged from the missions' communal structure or fled the missions altogether. This trajectory reveals the effects of sudden exposure to new cultural values, a largely foreign way of life, and the market economy on a previously sheltered people.",,,English,REVIEW

His complex thought contains much of vital importance to understanding contemporary global issues from economics to education and, of course, philosophy and religion. Theology mediates between religion and culture. Theology of religions is the discipline that thematizes the relationship of Christianity to other religions. Three decades of effort by specialists have generated a theological 'Babel'. The confusion and lack of a cumulative result have led to alternative paths to the discipline: a comparative theology of religious engagement in the US, and an intercultural theology in Europe. Still, the impasse remains. Lonergan offers dynamic structures, heuristic tools, and a collaborative framework for specialists to rise to a higher viewpoint and move toward a comprehensive understanding of the fact and significance of religious diversity.

This dissertation analyzes the historical development of solidarity in the Church's encyclical tradition, and then offers an examination and comparison of the unique contributions of John Paul II and the Jesuit theologian Jon Sobrino to contemporary understandings of solidarity. Ultimately, I argue that understanding solidarity as spiritual exercise integrates the wisdom of John Paul II's conception of solidarity as the virtue for an interdependent world with Sobrino's insights on the ethical implications of Christian spirituality, orthopraxis, and a commitment to communal liberation. The dissertation probes the relationship between spirituality and ethics in general, and Ignatian spirituality and Catholic social teaching, in particular. My analysis of solidarity in the encyclical tradition (Chapter 1) provides an historical overview of the incremental development of solidarity in the writings of successive popes and ecclesial councils from Pius XII through Paul VI. In considering the unique contributions of John Paul II, I turn first to the theological and philosophical formation of Karol Wojtyla and the sociopolitical context of Poland (Ch. 2). My analysis then turns to a consideration of Pope John Paul II's social encyclicals (Ch. 3), with the goal of offering a definition of solidarity that integrates his intellectual formation and social context with the development of solidarity in the official social tradition. Next, I examine the development of solidarity in the writings of Jon Sobrino, first through an analysis of his intellectual and spiritual formation in the revolutionary context of El Salvador (Ch. 4), and then through an analysis of his unique theological contributions to the topic (Ch. 5). Based on Sobrino, I offer an articulation of solidarity as spiritual exercise as an original contribution to the development of solidarity in the Catholic social tradition (Ch. 6).",,,English,REVIEW

Ústředním bodem práce je Campionova dramatická činnost. Z důvodu souvislostí řádového divadla s pedagogickým působením jezuitů je značná pozornost věnována jezuitskému školskému systému a výukovým předmětům, které se k divadelní praxi vážou nejvíce – rétorice a poetice. Práce ukazuje, že pro zkoumání díla Edmunda Campiona a jezuitského divadla je klíčové pochopení jezuitské spirituality a principů řádového vzdělávacího systému, jehož bylo divadlo pevnou součástí. Proto je v práci představen Campionův ideál mladého vzdělance načrtnutý ve spise De iuvene academico.

The main topic of the thesis is Campion´s dramatic activity. Because of the close relations of the order theatre to the pedagogical activity, considerable attention is paid to the Jesuit educational system and the subjects connected with the theatre practice – rhetorics and poetics. The thesis points out that it is the understanding of the Jesuit spirituality and the principles of the order educational system, part of which the Jesuit theatre was, which is necessary for studying Campion's works and the Jesuit theatre. That is the reason why Campion´s ideal of the young intellectual in De iuvene academico is introduced in the thesis. Further on the thesis focuses on the Campion´s work De imitatione rhetorica and on handbooks of poetics and rhetorics by several Jesuit authors.

It then applies this philosophy to a range of literature on grace and discerns, in the historical data, a basic line of intellectual progress. For this reason, this chapter implements a genetic method. More specifically, the chapter proposes an explanatory framework for understanding the contemporary transposition of scholastic metaphysics. Special attention is placed on the notion of grace as experience in relation to the evolution of theology as a science. The first chapter implements a genetic method to chart the developments in the history of the theology of grace. The last section of that chapter sketches the basic contours of a development that enabled a transposition from the second to the third stage of meaninga development that made possible a description of grace in terms of consciousness. The second chapter addresses the question of grace and consciousness in the context of Lonergans thought. In this chapter, I bring to light the complexities and challenges of identifying and describing grace as a datum of human experience. I also attempt to offer the Lonergan scholar some guidance by developing a set of normative criteria that will assist him in navigating these complexities and surmounting these challenges. The chapter is not an exercise in foundational theology but is written from a dialectical and methodological viewpoint. The dialectical and methodological work of the second chapter will prepare for the task of the third chapter. Chapter three compares Rahners and Lonergans theologies of grace; it focuses on a comparison of Lonergans notion of being-in-love unrestrictedly and Rahners notion of the supernatural existential in order to clarify their respective positions and to demonstrate an affinity in their writings on grace.

I argue that religious toleration extends from what is permissible in spiritual practice and belief, to what is permissible in print, and texts on religious toleration encouraged writers to contemplate the status of the discourse to which they contributed. Although the study begins and ends with analysis of two authors whose writings on toleration have received extensive critical attention, this dissertation also applies the latest theoretical framework for understanding religious toleration to writers whose contribution to the literature of toleration has previously been less well documented. Thomas More's Utopia (1516) outlines an ideal state with apparently progressive institutions and social practices, including property shared in common, abolition of the monetary system, and religious toleration. Contrary to the view of previous criticism, however, the image of a tolerant society in More's Utopia is unlike the modern ideal of toleration as a foundational principal of modern pluralism. Although More also argued against toleration of heresy in his later polemical works, he engaged with the concept of toleration to contemplate the efficacy of the dialogue as a persuasive tool. Most importantly, More developed the ideal of polemical toleration, which held that participants in a debate should create a textual space characterized by moderately-toned language and the suspension of judgment for the time it takes to persuade and ultimately convert one's opponent. As this study shows, More's works reveal greater ambivalence towards polemical toleration than they do towards religious toleration of the heretical sects he so despised. This study also analyzes the role of religious toleration in John Foxe's Actes and Monuments (1563–1583). Foxe's work has traditionally been received as a polarizing statement on the nature of the ""true"" and ""false"" churches, but in its condemnation of persecution Foxe develops a tolerant authorial ethos that furthers his polemical goals. A chapter focusing on The Jesuit polemicist Robert Parsons examines how this writer too used the concepts of religious and polemical toleration for complex rhetorical purposes. Parsons employs the idea of toleration as a flexible rhetorical trope, often veiling critiques of the Elizabethan religious establishment behind appeals for toleration of English Roman Catholics. The study concludes with a discussion of John Milton's Areopagitica (1644), which argued for a broad freedom of the press and for toleration of Protestant sects by the government and by the Church of England. The limits of toleration circumscribed in Areopagitica are replicated in Paradise Lost (1667, 1674), which echoes the terms of the tolerationist debate in a way that tempts readers to view the rebel angels as a religious minority, only to reveal that some religious groups should not be tolerated. These chapters all show that toleration was a thoroughly vexed topic, and one that was closely tied to the art of persuasive language.",,,English,REVIEW

Dans les CEEMJ, qui accueillent des EM de toute religion, la fréquentation reste maximale du fait des excellents résultats de l'entraide aux études; mais la rencontre pastorale s'y heurte aux mêmes difficultés. L'obstacle principal aux rencontres portant sur la théologie orientée vers la médecine (inviolabilité de la vie humaine, maladie, souffrance, mort) est aussi le manque de temps des EM. Le même obstacle empêche une rencontre suffisante pour transmettre aux EM la justification des principes magistériels de bioéthique et de faire une comparaison avec les principes des autres religions. En dépit de ces obstacles, très difficiles à surmonter, la rencontre avec les EM devrait être maintenue autant que possible.||Formal contacts between the Roman Catholic Church and students of healthcare, especially medical students, either in Catholic Fellowships in Universities (CFUs) under the auspices of chaplains, or in Centres for Mutual Support in Medical Studies run by Jesuits (CMSMSJs), as Laennec Centre in Paris, began in France during the last quarter of the XIXth century. The number of these contacts in CFUs reached a peak in the middle of the XXth century but thereafter suffered a steep decline. This was at a time when the number of medical students had actually increased. In contrast, attendance at CMSMSJs, which admit students irrespective of their religion, remained at a maximal level. This doctoral thesis is based on surveys of 31 CFUs and 3 CMSMSJs in which contacts currently take place. It examines the pastoral, theological and bioethical aspects of these contacts and considers how they might be facilitated. In the CFUs, obstacles to pastoral contact include a general decrease in religious observance and increasing pressures of time on medical students. In the CMSMSJs, attendance by students, whatever their religion, remains maximal owing to the excellent study support provided. However, the pastoral contact with Catholic students is confronted with similar difficulties. Pressure of time remains the main obstacle to discussions on the theology of healthcare (problems relating to sanctity of human life, illness, suffering and death). The same obstacle hinders participation by medical students in discussions justifying Roman Catholic bioethical principles and comparison of these principles with those of other religions. Despite these difficulties, almost impossible to overcome, it is recommended that contacts between these Roman Catholic bodies and medical students should be maintained as far as possible.",,,French,REVIEW

The 'education question,' as it has come to be known, will be approached from several perspectives. First, an examination of proposals for the reform of education during this period will reveal the contours of the debates over education. It will also make clear how questions of educational reform became intertwined with broader social and political concerns while simultaneously influencing the ways in which such broader concerns were approached. Second, the relationship between matters pedagogical, on the one hand, and questions of social and political organization, authority, and practice, on the other, will be explored in the analysis of texts which, while important to the debates over education, were concerned primarily with matters of philosophical, political, or social import Third, it will be shown that the debates over education served as a political channel through which members of the French ""public"" could and did participate in, and communicate their views about, the new political system that was taking shape after 1789. Fourth, the attempts to establish a new mode of politics during the early years of the Revolution will be reconsidered alongside, and in light of, the debates over education; on this point, particular attention will be paid to the Constitution of 1791 and to issues of political representation.

Comprised of multiple, superimposed, and perforated shells, concealed windows, and light chambers, these domes display an illusionistic and scenographic quality suggestive of contemporary ephemeral and scenographic decorations. This dissertation examines Vittone's openwork domes and interprets them as a type of sacred theater, a theatrum sacrum perpetuum, in which the shells and concealed windows are understood to function like the wings and hidden lamps of a stage set. In conceiving the openwork dome as sacred theater Vittone integrated various strands of Italian Baroque architecture—the conventional and the unorthodox, the academic and the bizarre—to achieve a synthesis of the highest order. Chapter One discusses Vittone's taste for illusionism as it was formed during his architectural apprenticeship in Piedmont and his years of study at the Accademia di San Luca in Rome, where he copied drawings of ephemeral decorations and scenographic caprices by Carlo Fontana, Johann Bernhard Fisher von Erlach, Filippo Juvarra, Andrea Pozzo, and other masters. Chapter Two examines the prominence given by Vittone in his architectural theory to considerations of illumination and illusionism in which, above all, the 'voluptuous genius' of the eye is to be delighted and satisfied. Chapter Three investigates Vittone's designs for ephemeral and scenographic decorations, including catafalques, fireworks machines, and temporary apparati for the sacred theater of the Quarantfiore Devotion, and their translation into permanent architecture. Chapter Four examines Vittone's designs for openwork domes and pendentives, those with interlaced ribs and those with perforated shells, relating them to designs by Guarino Guarini and Guarini's followers in Piedmont, including Gian Giacomo Plantery, Filippo Giovanni Battista Nicolis di Robilant, Giuseppe Gerolamo Buniva, and Mario Ludovico Quarini, as well as to designs by Fontana, Fischer von Erlach, Juvarra, and other academicians. Chapter Five relates Vittone's openwork domes to quadratura painting, itself a form of sacred theater that relies on perspectival foreshortening and other optical devices. It considers also the Neo-Platonic and hermetic strains of Vittone's architectural thought and the debt it owed to the ideas of Emanuele Tesauro, Paolo Segneri, Daniello Bartoli, and other Jesuits, as well as to the hagiographies and writings of various medieval saints, including St. Bernard of Clairvaux and St. Clare of Assisi.",,,English,REVIEW

Initially known for the monumental debate with the Dominican Thomism of the Revue Thomiste, this group consists of some of the greatest theologians of the twentieth century. One of the more prominent of them was the French Jesuit Jean Daniélou. Not only did Daniélou set off the debate with the Dominican Thomists when he penned ""La Orientations Présentes de la Pensée Religieuse,"" but he continued to produce important documents in the areas of patristics, spirituality and ecumenism. Equally important as such monumental works as his Origène, Bible et Liturgie and Histoire des Doctrines Chrétiennes avant Nicée are his works on Christian spirituality.||One of the most important of Daniélou’s insights is his understanding of the relationship between theology and spirituality. Since the late middle ages, scholars have increasingly grown accustomed to dichotomizing theology and spirituality. However, more recently, scholars such as Mark McIntosh have made convincing arguments for the natural coherence of the formerly opposed disciplines and in turn made a case for the inclusion of ""mystical theology"" within the realm of the academy. This view certainly accords with Daniélou's understanding of the relationship between theology and spirituality and an investigation into his theology of prayer will serve to elucidate how he understands this relationship. In turn, it becomes clear that a unified vision of theology and spirituality enables the theologian to lay bare humanity's true vocation. Humanity is not a true humanity when it does not experience contemplation, adoration and worship. Therefore, I refer to this aspect of Daniélou's thought as his doxological humanism.",,,English,REVIEW

Trata-se, é certo, duma pesquisa bibliográfica, duma releitura das fontes acerca dos Tupinambá, povo indígena que habitou a costa brasileira no século XVI, e constatar as tensões, de Hans Staden a Viveiros de Castro, entre as mais diversas e, não raro, coliden-tes, interpretações da prática canibalesca indígena. Tem-se o propósito de mostrar, ao longo deste trabalho, de que maneira a declarada guerra verbal, manifesta numa acerbada polêmica religiosa, entre o franciscano André Thevet e o protestante Jean de Léry, marcaram profundamente, até os tempos da etnologia ameríndia do último século, as partições ao meio do canibal tupinambá. De um lado, o do cosmógrafo, surgiu uma corrente interpretativa baseada na utilização da metáfora católica do canibalismo, que vai culminar, depois de seguir pelos jesuítas, no ro-mantismo de José de Alencar e nas visões psicanalíticas de Estevão Pinto. Por outro lado, seguindo pela influência do pastor calvinista, descobrir-se-á outra corrente, marcadamente anticatólica, calcada na interpretação do canibalismo tupinambá pela vingança, que vai culmi-nar, decididamente, na antropologia política de Hélène Clastres e na crítica de Viveiros de Castro ao conceito de religião. Apesar, distante de postular qualquer unidade no interior destas correntes, ressaltar-se-á figuras de transição, como Florestan Fernandes que vindica o culto an-cestral (uma razão religiosa, decerto) como explicação para o canibalis-mo tupinambá, articulando o primeiro com o que chama vindita, que não é mais que a famosa justificativa da antropofagia pela vingança. A cha-ve para que o sucesso da pesquisa, crê-se, fica no conceito de sacrifício que, mostrar-se-á, transforma-se de metáfora em categoria explicativa do canibalismo tupinambá. Contudo, com o passar dos anos, surgiram outras vias interpretativas da antropofagia indígena, duas precisamente: uma ecológica, representada por Marvin Harris, e outra negacionista, famosa, sobretudo, pelos trabalhos de William Arens. A primeira surge dum resgate dos trabalhos de Evans-Pritchard acerca do canibalismo zande; a segunda, por seu turno, num contexto de crítica e reforma de certa antropologia colonialista.||This work is a study on the successive dichotomization of the Tupinamba cannibal in five hundred years of Tupinologic literature. This is, of course, a bibliographical search, a rereading of the sources about the Tupinamba, indigenous people who inhabited the Brazilian coast in the sixteenth century, to find the tensions, of Hans Staden to Viveiros de Castro, among the most diverse and conflicting interpretations of indi-genous cannibalistic practice. It is the intention to show, throughout this work, how the verbal war declared, express in religious controversy, between the Franciscan Andre Thevet and the Protestant Jean de Lery, deeply marked, until the time of the last century Amerindian ethnology, the partitions in the middle of the Tupinamba cannibal. On one hand, of the cosmography, appears a stream of interpretation based on the use of the Catholic metaphor of cannibalism, followed by the Jesuits, which will lead in the Jose de Alencar's romanticism and Estevao Pinto's psychoanalytic views. Moreover, following the influence of Calvinist pas-tor, will find another stream, markedly anti-catholic, based on interpre-tation of cannibalism of the Tupinamba for revenge, which will lead in the political anthropology of Helene Clastres and the critical of religion of Viveiros de Castro. Although, far from postulating any unit in these streams, will be show a transitional figure like Florestan Fernandes, who vindicate the ancestral cult (a religious reason, certainly) as an explana-tion of tupinamba cannibalism, articulating it with he calls vindita, which is nothing more than then the famous reasons of revenge by anth-ropophagy. The key to the successes of this research, it is believed, is the concept of sacrifice that becomes the metaphor in explanatory cate-gory. However, over the years, there were others ways of interpreting indigenous anthropophagy: ecological, represented for Marvin Harris, and another denial, famous, represented especially for the works of William Arens. The first appears of the redemption of the Evans-Pritchard's works about zande cannibalism; the second, in a context of criticism and reform of the colonial anthropology.",,,Portuguese,REVIEW

Possessing slaves became a means of exercising Catholic entitlement to own property. However, Jesuits proved ambivalent about their responsibilities as plantation managers and they had difficulty securing the prosperity of their estates. By the 1830's, concern developed about nativist opposition to Catholicism. Jesuits feared as slave owners, they had become fodder for anti-Catholicism.

Elle se fonde sur la vertu aristotélicienne de l’eutrapélie pour éviter les excès. Synonyme de la demi-mesure et du juste milieu, le moindre mal théâtral est la solution pour lutter contre le désenchantement (nécessaire) du monde. L’étude littéraire, linguistique et l’histoire des spectacles permettent de forger cette dramaturgie de la comédie droite et modeste, que lui-même n’a jamais explicitée. Maggi est envisagé sous trois angles: l’homme du siècle c'est-à-dire l’élève et l’ami des jésuites, formé à leur école de l’oralité et le poète, qui, de l’éloge pétrarquisant d’éros, passe à la célébration de l’amour divin. Cet homme du siècle expérimente les genres théâtraux, de la pastorale aux drames en musique, suivant une veine comique qui annonce ses comédies. Maggi est ensuite dramaturge : il centre sa satire sur la ville. La comédie nouvelle est urbaine : la Milan des affaires, celle du cloître et celle des salons sont autant d’occasions d’édifier son public par l’arme du plurilinguisme et de l’ironie, faisant émerger un mythe du bon peuple urbain, avec son personnage clé: Meneghino. Maggi est enfin chorège (organisateur de spectacles) et l’on comprend de l’étude des conditions de représentations au Collège des Nobles de Milan l’importance de la conjoncture dans l’écriture des comédies, les ancrant profondément dans leur époque et limitant leur fortune théâtrale dans les siècles suivants.| |In his five dialectical comedies, Lombard playwright Carlo Maria Maggi (1630–1699) proposed to reform comedy. In between his conservative Jesuitical education and his search for moral renewal through social satire, Maggi elaborated a dramaturgy of the lesser evil based on Aristotle’s eutrapely, which is to limit excess. The lesser evil, a synonym for half-measures and the happy medium, is the perfect antidote to disillusionment. Through a literary and linguistic analysis and a study of past performances of the plays, this dramaturgy of an upright and modest comedy, never theorized by Maggi himself, becomes apparent. First, Maggi is viewed as a man of his century. He is seen as both the student and friend of the Jesuits, who educated him in the oral tradition, and as the poet, who evolved from the praise of Eros in Petrarch’s style towards a celebration of God’s love. He experimented with different dramatic genres, from pastoral to melodrama, following a comic thread that would lead him to write his comedies. Maggi is also a playwright, his satire focusing on the city. This new comedy was urban: taking Milan’s business life, clergy, and sociability as themes, he was able to educate his audience, using plurilingualism and irony, thus creating the myth of the good urban people and its symbolic character, Meneghino. Finally, Maggi is a corago who is to stage plays, and only after studying the conditions of creation at Milan’s Collegio de’ Nobili, is it possible to assess the sheer importance of the historical context in the process of writing the comedies. Being deeply anchored in the late 17th century, they were to have limited success on the stage in the centuries to come.",,,French,REVIEW

Crucial to understanding this loss of traditional Amerindian culture, however, is a parallel understanding of the cultural and intellectual forces coming from Europe which shaped and often restricted the Jesuits’ attitudes toward native customs. Examining the first fifty years of the cross-cultural encounter through the lens of dream interpretation, this paper argues that the Jesuits made several adjustments to their initial assumptions and responses toward native dreams. Although the Jesuits originally denounced all native dreams as superstitious, the advent of native convert dreams forced the Jesuits to recognize the placement of at least some native dreams within traditional Christian categories of visions and miracles, even though some of these dreams retained characteristics which they condemned in traditional native dreams. Over time, however, the Jesuits’ accommodating policy drew criticisms from competing missionaries. Because the dispute centered on events in China rather than Canada, the acceptability of convert dreams was resolved first by a silence on the issue in public records and later by a retraction of the papal condemnation of the Chinese Rites ruling and certain accomodationist practices. Ultimately, the issue of dreams reveals the deep tensions faced by the Jesuits in evaluating and accepting practices, even in part, that did not fit precisely into orthodox categories during a period when the Catholic Church, an institution that, like many other European centers of power, strove to buttress their institutional authority and to reduce the varieties of acceptable worship and belief in the face of enormous expansion in intellectual ideas and varieties of cultural practices around the world.",,,English,KEEP

In chapter one I set the context of developments and crises in the twentieth century, and propose that Bernard Lonergan's theological method provides a way to engage the complex issues involved in interreligious relations. Because he offers a cognitional theory and an epistemology that are empirically grounded in the believing subject, Lonergan's approach is firmly and securely rooted and yet is open to the concrete reality of the religious other. In chapter two I summarise and refine elements of Lonergan's analysis of the dynamics of consciousness and propose that they form a common ground"" on which believers from different religions might meet. I extend that to the construction and mediation of meaning in chapter three, and to religious meaning in chapter four. In particular, I use these dynamics to distinguish between ""spirituality"" and ""religion"". I conclude that spirituality forms the ""common horizon"" in which believers from different religions might meet. In chapter five I show how these same dynamics underlie the structural relations between different religions, the personal relations built by dialogue between believers from different religions, and a theology of religious plurality. In chapter six I show how familiarity with these dynamics enlightens our understanding of selected core themes in Christian theology. My innovative treatment of aspects of Trinitarian theology, in particular the divine missions, will underpin my argument for Christian involvement in interreligious relations. In chapter seven I show how Christian revelation sheds light on the dynamics of human consciousness. ...""--Abstract.",,,English,REVIEW

The period under study spans the time from 1653, when the Society of Jesus settled in the city of Belém, to 1759, when the Jesuits were expelled from Portuguese colonies. This thesis focuses in particular on the artistic work of both jesuits and indians carried out in the workshops at the Jesuit School of Santo Alexandre in Belém in the 18th century. The thesis seeks to trace the dissemination of the models created in such workshops throughout the Jesuit churches and chapels that were built along the borders of the River Amazon and its tributaries, especially those located in the Jesuit aldeias, vilas and fazendas closer to Belém (Vila de Nossa Senhora de Nazaré da Vigia, Vila Souza do Caeté, Mortigura, Gibirié, Mamaiacú, Jaguarari, among others). The hypothesis under investigation in this study is that Belém, in addition to being an economic and commercial hub, was also an artistic center providing models, working methods and technical expertise for the entire Jesuit artistic community in the Grão Pará. The title Tintas da Terra, Tintas do Reino summarizes the core idea underlying this thesis, namely that the Jesuit legacy in the art and architecture of the Grão Pará missions is the result of the work of europeans and indians, who in doing so resorted to their respective cultural traditions.",,,Portuguese,REVIEW

It remains a major theological problem that needs to be addressed within the mainline churches of Zimbabwe today. Instead of ignoring or dismissing the ancestor cult, which deeply influences the socio-political, religious, and economic lives of the Shona, churches in Zimbabwe should initiate a Christology that is based on it. Such a Christology would engage the critical day-to-day issues that make the Shona turn to their ancestors. Among these concerns are daily protection from misfortune, maintaining good health and increasing longevity, successful rainy seasons and food security, and responsible governance characterized by economic and political stability. Since the mid-16th century arrival of Jesuit missionaries in the Mutapa Kingdom, the Church has realized that many African Christians resorted to their ancestors in times of crisis. Although both Catholic and Protestant missionaries from the 1700s through the early 1900s fiercely attacked Shona traditional beliefs as superstitious and equated ancestors with evil spirits, the cult did not die. Social institutions, such as schools and hospitals provided by missionaries, failed to eliminate ancestral beliefs. Even in the 21st century, many Zimbabweans consult their ancestors. The Shona message to the Church remains ""Not without My Ancestors."" This dissertation examines the significance of the ancestors to the Shona, and how selected denominations and new religious movements have interpreted and accommodated ancestral practices. Taking the missiological goal of ""self-theologizing"" as the framework, this dissertation proposes a ""tripartite Christology"" of ""Jesus the Family Ancestor"", ""Jesus the Tribal Ancestor,"" and ""Jesus the National Ancestor,"" which is based on the Shona ""tripartite ancestrology."" Familiar ecclesiological and liturgical language, idioms, and symbols are used to contribute to the wider Shona understanding of Jesus as the ancestor par excellence, in whom physical and spiritual needs--including those the ordinary ancestors fail to meet--are fulfilled.",,,English,REVIEW

This study argues that Loyola's student protesters were acting as Catholics against situations they believed were immoral and unjust. In this sense, they were ahead of the Jesuit clergy at Loyola, who took action only after student protest on those issues. Indeed, student protest filled a void of moral leadership that the Jesuit administration at Loyola failed to provide. Moreover, in the areas of student participation in university governance, changes in curriculum and university restrictions, and student rights and freedoms, the student protesters joined with Catholic commentators who advocated for major changes at the country's Catholic universities.",,,English,REVIEW

F., 1904–1984","The thesis explores the nature of organization and governance by applying a method of intentionality analysis as elaborated by the Canadian philosopher and theologian, Bernard Lonergan, in his two monumental works, Insight : a study of human understanding, and Method in theology. The project arose from the writer's own experience in management education and consultancy. Admittedly, intentionality analysis has not been a major theme in the management literature. However, the late Sumantra Ghoshal drew attention to the consequences of neglecting the dimension of intentionality in business education and management theory, such consequences as unethical practices and even the collapse of corporations, as was the case with Enron. In a paper published by the Academy of Management Learning and Education in 2005, Ghoshal raised a number of crucial and epistemological questions, though he offered no easy answers. In the effort to rise to Ghoshal's challenge, this thesis argues that Lonergan's method of intentionality analysis opens new ways to approach the theory and practice of management. It thereby suggests a model relevant to all managerial tasks. Hence, it repeatedly stresses the value of asking questions and of attending to data. It indicates what is involved in the understanding of a given situation, in the making of judgments based on experience, and in the deciding on particular courses of action. In so doing, the thesis clarifies a number of intricate epistemological questions, while emphasising throughout, the vital role of self-knowledge and self-possession. The thesis is essentially a step-by-step discussion of the various elements in intentionality analysis in the context of corporate management. Hence, for the sake of brevity, it designates its intentionality analysis method"" with the acronym, IAM (and in reference to organisational operations, IAMO). ...""--Abstract.",,,English,REVIEW

The analysis of the music and the drama stems from studies of the surviving manuscript scores, libretti, payment records and letters about the first performances. This dissertation also provides a discussion of the religious culture in which these operas took place by examining other contemporary primary sources such as sermons, histories of saints' lives, spiritual exercises, Jesuit school plays, books of manners and social decorum, and accounts of festivals held in Rome during the papacy of Pope Urban VIII.",,,English,REVIEW

Balthasar views the death of Jesus as primarily a drama of vicarious atonement carried out between Father and Son wherein the interrelated themes of divine wrath and judgment play important roles. Emphasis is placed upon points of contrast with Schwager.|Chapter III highlights essential points of Schwager's soteriology that are of relevance to this study. Schwager's work is inspired by a contemporary view that finds theological meaning in the problematic of human violence. This gives him a hermeneutical framework that leads to a fresh understanding of the event of the cross along with an associated view of divine wrath and judgment that contrasts with that of Balthasar.|The analysis comprising Chapter IV illuminates the important similarities and distinctions between the two theologians and clarifies the critical exchange between them. The critique offered by each side is organized by topic and analyzed for efficacy.|A final chapter assesses the arguments and analyzes them for the contribution they make to our understanding of salvation. One section reviews some of the more recent related work for its ability to help resolve the difficult issues raised by the contrasting views of Balthasar and Schwager.

Im westlichen Diskurs herrscht eine Auffassung vor, der zufolge die chinesischen Schriftzeichen eine „fast naturalistische Darstellung“ von Dingen seien, die unabhängig von der gesprochenen Sprache im Sinne „eines visuellen Objekts“ funktionieren soll. Dabei wird die Tatsache, dass auch sie wie alle anderen Schriftsysteme zur Wiedergabe der gesprochenen Wörter verwendet werden und dadurch funktionieren, ausgeblendet. Die Vorstellung der sprachunabhängigen chinesischen Schrift wirkt darüber hinaus auch auf die Kulturtheorien ein, die auf der Schrift basierend die chinesische bzw. asiatische Kultur zu charakterisieren und sie mit der europäischen zu vergleichen versuchen. Dabei ist zu beobachten, dass die angenommene sprachunabhängige Bildhaftigkeit oder Konkretheit der chinesischen Schrift zwar einerseits Grund für eine Aufwertung ist, wobei das aus ihr resultierende Denkmodell als ein alternatives des westlichen Denkens aufgefasst wird, dass aber letztendlich aus derselben Auffassung auch das negative Urteil entspringt, mit jener visuellen Konkretheit gehe ein ‚geringer Abstand zu den Gegenständen‘ einher und daraus folge eine Unfähigkeit zum abstrakten Denken bei dem, der sich dieser Schrift bediene. Die Frage, die vorliegende Arbeit durchzieht, lautet daher: Woher stammt dieser ‚Mythos‘ der chinesischen Schrift, der wiederum zurückwirkt auf das westliche Ostasienbild? Und warum bewahrt er sich so hartnäckig im westlichen Denken, dass seine Nachwirkung bis in aktuelle Theorien zu beobachten ist? Wie ist die ambivalente Einschätzung chinesischer bzw. ostasiatischer Kultur in ihnen zu verstehen, die aus derselben ideographischen Auffassung chinesischer Schrift stammt? Durch eine kritische Auseinandersetzung mit der Rezeptionsgeschichte der chinesischen Schrift unter Berücksichtigung des abendländischen China-, bzw. Ostasienbilds wird versucht, darauf zu antworten.||This dissertation deals with the Western views of Chinese characters. In Western discourses the Chinese written language has generally been viewed as a naturalistic representation of things, close to visual images (pictographs) or as a means of conveying ideas (ideographs), unrelated to spoken language. The fact that they reproduce spoken language like all other writing systems has been underexplored. Under this assumption, cultural theories have defined Chinese or Asian cultures as essentially distinct from European cultures. However, the language-independency and concreteness of Chinese script provides reason for revaluation of those views that consider the Chinese (or Asian) ways of thinking as an alternative to Western thought: that which ultimately arises from the negative judgments that those with visual concreteness are farther detached from objects, and are, therefore, unable to exercise abstract thinking. Through a critical analysis of the history of discourses of Chinese writings, this work address the following questions: Whence comes the ‘myth ''of the Chinese character, which, in turn, reinforces the Western views of Asia: why it remains so persistent in Western views as observed in contemporary cultural theories; how the ambivalent appreciation of Chinese or East Asian-culture resulted from the same ideographic view of the Chinese written language.",,,German,REVIEW

This study concerns the comparison of the motivations, program strategies, and organization strategies of the internationalization policies of two Jesuit universities: Sophia University in Japan and Georgetown University in the United States. This study focuses on understanding internationalization policies at the two universities and developing a conceptual framework that might be useful in the expansion of scholarship of internationalization theory. There are three key research questions: (a) Is the noticeable shift from social and cultural rationales for internationalization to for-profit rationale ubiquitous?; (b) How do the policies of internationalization of the two universities resonate with the particular contexts surrounding them?; and (c) To what extent do the programs of internationalization reflect the core value of the Jesuit philosophy of education which is to prepare men and women for others? Qualitative comparative case study was conducted at both research sites through semi-structured interviews with senior administrators, deans, faculty, and administrative staff members. On-site materials are collected and analyzed. Cross-case analysis is used to compare and synthesize the findings of the two single case studies. This study found that no noticeable shift from socio-cultural rationale to for-profit rationale has taken place at the two universities. Despite financial constraints, the two universities' internationalization polices are affected most strongly by the socio-cultural rationale and the academic rationale. Sophia puts an emphasis on the motivation for intercultural understanding stemming from its history and origin, while Georgetown gives its highest attention to the motivation for human development. The two universities are able to appropriate their contexts and surroundings so that the universities' idiosyncratic features of local contexts play a significant role in defining their specific responses to the challenges of globalization which are inscribed in their international programs and projects. Finally, the Jesuit philosophy of education, ""men and women for others,"" plays a crucial role as a bedrock on which the direction of internationalization policies is defined. However, despite the strong relationship between the Jesuit philosophy of education and policy, there is only a weak correlation between the philosophy of education and programs. This research will contribute to a wider perspective on internationalization policies through cross-cultural comparative research at an institutional level, an expansion of literature about a global university, and a re-visioning of internationalization for the sake of conscientizing internationalization at an individual level and responsible internationalization at an institutional level.",,,English,KEEP

Until the eighteenth century, Church and State had been traditional partners in the governance of Spain’s American possessions. With the ascension of the Bourbon dynasty in 1700, however, this partnership between Church and State began to deteriorate. This change was due in full measure to the adoption by many royal ministers, including Manso de Velásco, of regalism, an ideology inspired by the European Enlightenment’s emphasis on reason over tradition which championed the supreme authority of the monarch in all matters of state. Regalist ministers believed that political power in the Spanish empire should be centered in the monarchy rather than shared with other politically powerful institutions, such as the Church. The regular orders (Franciscans, Dominicans, Augustinians, Mercedarians and later Jesuits) were particularly suspect since they answered to their leaders in Rome, and not to the king. I argue that Viceroy José Antonio Manso de Velásco, Conde de Superunda, abandoned campaigns against the Juan Santos Atahualpa rebels in 1751 because it weakened the power of the Franciscan Order in Peru. This conclusion challenges previous historiography which contends that Manso de Velásco ended campaigns against the Juan Santos rebels because colonial resources were overextended by the 1746 Lima Earthquake and the Lima Conspiracy and the Huarochirí Rebellion in 1750. This thesis also calls for a re-evaluation of the periodization of the Bourbon reforms in the Spanish Americas, which some scholars argue do not begin in earnest until after the Seven Years War (1756–1763). I contend that Manso de Velásco’s actions against the Ocopa missionaries, along with other reforms throughout Peru, indicate an early Bourbon reform period which focused primarily on clerical reforms.",,,English,REVIEW

Having grown used to the repeated attacks of nativists upon the fidelity and competency of the German and Irish immigrants flooding the country, Democratic and Catholic newspapers (the latter often run by the Churchs U.S. hierarchy) spilled copious amounts of ink defending the adopted citizens they valued as constituents and congregants. These efforts frequently consisted of arguments proving the Americanness of the recent arrivals, pointing to their hard work, love of liberty, and willingness to sacrifice for their adopted country. However, immigrants sometimes undermined this portrayal (in the eyes of nativists) by prioritizing their ethnic and/or religious identities over their identities as new United States citizens. Even some opportunities seemingly tailor-made for the defenders of Catholicism and the nations adopted citizens could go awry. When the supposedly well-disciplined Irish volunteers from Savannah, Georgia brawled with another Georgia company on a Rio Grande steamboat, the fight threatened to confirm the worst stereotypes of the nations new Irish citizens. In addition, although the Jesuits John McElroy and Anthony Rey gained admirers in the Army and in the rest of the country for their untiring care for wounded and sick soldiers in northern Mexico, anti-Catholic activists denounced them for taking advantage of vulnerable young men to win converts for the Church. Using the letters and personal papers of soldiers, Catholic and Democratic newspapers, military records, and the diaries and correspondence of Fathers John McElroy and Anthony Rey, this study illuminates the lives and actions of Catholic and immigrant volunteers and the debates over their participation in the war. Shedding light on this understudied and misunderstood facet of the war with Mexico, it adds to the scholarship on immigration and religion in antebellum America, illustrating the contentious and controversial process by which immigrants and their supporters tried to carve out a place in U.S. society. Understanding this process aids our comprehension of immigration assimilation and the contested nature of Americanness in the mid-nineteenth century.",,,English,REVIEW

F., 1904–1984","The purpose of this dissertation is to demonstrate that Bernard Lonergan's theory of conversion can be applied to the fictional lives of the three main characters in Susan Howatch's novels of the Starbridge series. This will validate Lonergan's theory and provide a comprehensible demonstration of it as well. The rationale of this study is based on two well-established assumptions. The first, articulated by Erich Auerbach in modern literary theory, is that literature mirrors reality; the second, expressed by Paul Ricoeur, among others, is that an author expresses his/her own worldview. Howatch's three main characters, Charles Ashworth, Jonathan Darrow, and Neville Aysgarth, reflect reality because as clergymen in the Church of England, they sin repeatedly, just as every Christian does. Afterward, through a process of redemption, they confront their sin, repent, and then work to put things right. Writing of those who experience conversion, Bernard Lonergan says that ""they have to learn with humility that religious development is dialectical, that the task of repentance and conversion is life-long."" This is precisely the process of conversion that these fictitious characters demonstrate. Susan Howatch herself has written on the ways in which the ""religion"" of an author necessarily seeps into his/her works. In addition, Howatch admits to having been in the throes of a conversion experience as she wrote the Starbridge novels. On many levels, then, these novels represent reality. Thus they provide a suitable vehicle for applying, exploring, and understanding Bernard Lonergan's complicated theory of conversion.",,,English,REVIEW

This project focuses on the prosody of three major poets, William Blake, W. B. Yeats, and T. S. Eliot. It explores the relationship between each poet's poetic sound structures and his spiritual aims. The project argues that in Blake's prophetic poems The Four Zoas, Milton, and Jerusalem, in Yeats's middle and late poetry, and in Eliot's post-conversion poetry, the careful structuring of the non-semantic features of language serves to model a process through which one may arrive at the threshold of a spiritual reality. The introductory chapter situates these poets' works within the genre of mystical writing; establishes the epistemological nature of poetic sound and its relationship to mystical expression; considers the historical and personal exigencies that influence each poet's prosodic choices; and outlines the prosodic method by which their poetry is scanned. Chapter one addresses William Blake's efforts to re-vision Milton's Christian epic Paradise Lost by means of a logaoedic prosody intended to move the reader from a rational to a spiritual perception of the self and the world. Chapter two considers the development of W.B. Yeats's contrapuntal prosody as integral to his attempt to make of himself a modern poet and to his antithetical mystical philosophy. Chapter three explores the liminal prosody of T. S. Eliot by which he creates an incantatory movement that points to a spiritual reality behind material reality. The project concludes with a consideration of the spiritual aims of Gerard Manley Hopkins and H.D. (Hilda Doolittle) and posits a revaluation of Hopkins' sprung rhythm and H.D.'s revisionary chain of sound as prosodic practices intrinsic to their spiritual aims.||Ce projet porte sur la prosodie de trois poètes importants, William Blake, W.

L'argumentaire du projet soutient que dans les poèmes prophétiques de Blake, The Four Zoas, Milton, et Jerusalem, dans la poésie du milieu et de la fin de la carrière de Yeats, et dans la poésie après-conversion d'Eliot la structuration attentive des figures non-sémantiques du langage sert à façonner un processus à travers lequel on pourrait arriver au seuil de la réalité spirituelle. L'introduction sert à situer les oeuvres des trois poètes dans le genre de l'écriture mystique, à établir la nature épistémologique du son poétique et de sa relation à l'expression mystique, à considérer les exigences historiques et personnelles qui ont influencé les choix prosodiques de chaque poète, et à cerner la méthode prosodique selon laquelle on scande leur poésie. Le premier chapitre aborde les efforts de William Blake de revoir l'épopée chrétienne Paradise Lost de Milton selon une prosodie logaédique dont l'intention est de transporter le lecteur d'une perception rationnelle à une perception spirituelle de soi et du monde. Le deuxième chapitre considère le développement de la prosodie en contrepoint de W. B. Yeats comme étant intégral à sa tentative de se construire en tant que poète moderne et à sa philosophie mystique antithétique. Le chapitre trois examine la prosodie liminale de T. S.

I craft the answer to this question by studying the Spiritual Exercises of Saint Ignatius of Loyola. I claim an analogy between the central dynamic of the thirty-day retreat, whose guidelines are in the book of the Spiritual Exercises, and four operative principles that ought to constitute the structure of formation programs for Jesuit schools' faculty and staff in the educational tradition, identity and mission of the Society of Jesus. The four operative principles are discernment, desire, diakonia and decision. Formation that aims at training partners in education to share in the common mission of Jesuit schools happens best when these four operative principles inform the curriculum design and when they interplay during the actual process of forming the educators who work in Jesuit schools. Discernment is the under-girding principle because the Society of Jesus is engaged in education to form women and men who can discern, that is to say, who can decide from their in-depth values, convictions and aspirations. Desire is the operative principle of the first movement of the Spiritual Exercises, which corresponds to the first week of the retreat. Diakonia--the Greek word for service--draws upon the second movement of the Exercises, which expands beyond the second week of the retreat into the third and fourth ones. This second movement is unified by the idea of being inspired by Jesus Christ or from ""outside"" of the retreatants. Lastly, decision is the third movement of the Spiritual Exercises. Ignatius invites the exercitants to make a personal choice of a state of life at the core of the second week of the retreat. But decision as operative principle accompanies the retreatants until the end of their thirty-day experience. The doctoral program of the Boston College Institute of Religious Education and Pastoral Ministry is in theology and education. The dissertation is an academic exercise in the field of pastoral or practical theology at the intersection of education, theology and the means of church education inspired by the Spiritual Exercises. Therefore, besides the analogical reading of Ignatius's work, my method consists of putting the aforementioned operative principles in conversation with a select review of literature in the fields of transformative and reflective adult education, developmental psychology, responsible and collaborative leadership, pastoral ministry and educational change.",,,English,KEEP

Specifically, I argue that the Catholic sacramental imagination holds the potential to enact a public counter-narrative to the legal, rhetorical, and ideological structures that both legitimize and conceal the reality of institutionalized torture. I approach this task by examining the roots of the Catholic moral imagination in the sacramental traditions of the church's faith regarding the life, suffering, death, and resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth, and by arguing that this tradition necessarily implies certain ethical and theological claims (articulated in Catholic social teaching) regarding the inviolable dignity of the human person. Central to my study is the conviction that a theological response to torture is effective only insofar as it confronts, resists, and de-legitimizes the idolatrous pretensions of American empire. My point of departure lies primarily in the resources and warrants of my own faith tradition, notably a post-Vatican II sacramental theology. The basis of my argument lies in the claim that Catholic sacramentality is intrinsically ethical because it is rooted in the Paschal Mystery, which is historically and irrevocably linked to the commitment to justice for all who have suffered and died at the hand of empire. At the same time, I argue that this tradition, and the moral imagination it generates, contribute valuable resources to the task of forging a broader public consensus against torture and indefinite detention as legal responses to the global war on terror."" I approach the notion of a ""Catholic moral imagination"" as a response to torture in terms of an ideal yet to be fully realized. At the same time, I draw upon existing cultural and symbolic structures within the tradition which I argue are capable of eliciting moral outrage and effective political resistance to torture. These resources include a broadly sacramental and communal worldview, an estimable body of social thought whose cornerstone is the inviolable dignity of the human person, and a rich historical tradition of prophetic social engagement. The dissertation does not attempt a comprehensive sacramental or liturgical theology. Instead, it considers, in some depth, the sacramental dimensions of a broader alternative social imagination, one which seeks to counter our national amnesia around U.S. involvement in torture, to resist official narratives regarding the necessity and moral justification of torture, and to foster a different way of ""imagining"" our perceived enemies.""--Abstract, leaves i-ii.",,,English,REVIEW

Operative among these contemporary theologians' assumptions, though, is the notion that classical theism is ""perfect being theology"" and vice versa thereby conflating perfect being theology with aspects of the Christian tradition. Implicit within perfect being theology is a scientific methodology that reduces reality to only empirically verifiable facts.|But perhaps these theologians are ignoring important resources for resolving the dilemma--namely God's beauty. How might the peculiar beauty of the cross, then, understood in terms of God's theodrama--the economic Trinity as summary of the Gospel-- rather than as a perfect being address some of the concerns of relational theism? By critically appropriating Hans Urs von Balthasar's focus on Jesus Christ as the distinct speaking and doing form ( Gestalt ) of God's beauty, a form of divine communicative action, it is my contention that God's beauty is the fittingness seen in the incarnate Son's actions to the Father's will that radiates God's glory and enraptures properly perceiving subjects, transforming the imagination through the shaping power of the Spirit and drawing them to participate in God's drama of redemption.|I establish this thesis by conceptually expanding upon a relevant biblical motif found in the theological patterning of the Suffering Servant in Jeremiah and its connection with wisdom, linking it with a theological interpretation of Col 1–2:5. In doing so, God's actions in Christ's redemptive-creative suffering and glorious resurrection become necessary to defining God's beauty as the perfect attunement or fittingness of the incarnate Son's actions in the Spirit to the Father's will. Consequently, God's beauty requires action, imploring believers to imaginatively participate in God's theodrama. In resurrecting the imagination, I suggest that the imagination is transformed by participating in the beauty of God's trinitarian life revealed by the Spirit in incarnate Beauty (2 Cor 3:18). As such, we manifest fitting performances in the dramatic theater of God's glory.",,,English,REVIEW

One way to confront the dangers of loosing old privileges is through the redefinition and revival of old codes of conduct and behavior that in the past set them apart from the rest. In the process, old heroes considered instrumental in establishing and shaping their power are retrieved and glorified, and their heroic deeds offered as examples to emulate in the present. During the XVII Century, and in analogous circumstances, the Spanish Baroque writer Baltasar Gracián observes with trepidation the rapid changes in his own society, the breaking down of the social and political order of Imperial Spain. To protect his interests as member of the hegemonic group: —male, Catholic, noble and scholar—, he looks back in history and constructs heroic paradigms utilizing old heroes whose values embody his own. Since the heroic figures incarnate the ideals of the elite, there are neither heroes nor heroism outside the hegemonic class. This dissertation studies three texts by Baltasar Gracián (1601–1658): El Héroe (1637), El Discreto (1646), and El Criticón (Part I, 1651, Part II, 1653, Part III, 1657), that are centered on the heroic male, analyzing changes in the consecutive male heroic prototypes in light of the author's social and historical experience. Gracián's evolving heroic models respond to transformations in the hegemonic position of the Spanish state, moving from profuse optimism and idealism in his first text to disillusion and abandonment in the last one. The Jesuit's work is a crucible in which he tests Occidental values and heroics over his lifetime, adapting each heroic prescription to satisfy the political, historical, social and religious necessities of his present. Although Gracián's heroic formula changes over time, the connecting thread remains: the blood nobility of Castile/Aragón will save the hegemony of the nation. This elitism verbalizes a reactionary anachronism that negates the heroic essence, which is to act in the world on behalf of others. Gracián's texts are progressive, specular images of the author and his society. In all cases, the heroic figure functions as metonym of the Empire in which the strength of the hero confirms the power of the State.",,,Spanish,REVIEW

The problem of evil, in essence, asks, Why is evil present in the creation of an omnipotent and omnibenevolent God? Chapter 1 defines basic terms, such as 'problem of evil' and 'theodicy,' and frames the debate on evil and theism using recent work in analytic philosophy. I begin with David Hume's attack on 'natural religion' based on the reality of evil. The work of Hume sets the stage for later debates on evil in the analytic philosophy of religion. After Hume, I move to J. L. Mackie's presentation of the atheistic argument from evil, with a focus on Mackie's attack on the free-will defense. I then examine Alvin Plantinga's response to Mackie and Plantinga's endorsement of the free-will defense against Mackie's attack. My discussion of the pivotal Mackie-Plantinga debate on the problem of evil is followed by an examination of three contemporary figures within analytic philosophy who have offered Christian responses to the problem of evil---John Hick, Eleonore Stump, and Marilyn McCord Adams. In the midst of this discussion, I pause to compare the proposals of Plantinga, Hick, Richard Swinburne, and Peter van Inwagen on natural evil. Chapter 2 examines the trinitarian theology of Hans Urs von Balthasar in the context of recent and contemporary trinitarian theology, because I will argue that the doctrine of the Trinity is the essential Christian resource needed to answer the problem of evil. After rehearsing and critiquing the popular story of the rise and fall of trinitarian theology, as told by Karl Rahner, Catherine LaCugna, and others, I examine the tentative place of the Trinity in the doctrinal theology of Friedrich Schleiermacher and Paul Tillich and then the renewed emphasis on the Trinity found in Karl Barth and Rahner. The work of Barth and Rahner provides the framework in which to consider the thought of several major contemporary theologians on the Trinity---Jurgen Moltmann, Walter Kasper, Wolfhart Pannenberg, and John Zizioulas. Once the context has been set, I turn fully to the theology of the Trinity of Hans Urs von Balthasar. I argue that Balthasar's primary account of the immanent Trinity is one of reciprocal, self-giving, interpersonal love dynamically exchanged among distinct divine persons, who share fully and equally in the one divine essence of kenotic love, and that the economic Trinity, particularly in the Cross of Christ, makes trinitarian love present to human persons. In Chapter 3 I develop a theodicy based on Balthasar's theology of the Trinity. I begin by discussing the nature and purpose of theodicy and various recent attacks on the validity of the theological enterprise of theodicy. After clarifying the theological aims of a Christian theodicy, and setting to the side common but inadequate responses to the problem of evil, I turn to my own understanding of a successful Christian theodicy. I begin with Scripture (Genesis, Job, and the Gospels) and then use Pope John Paul II's Salvifici Doloris as a bridge from the Gospel account of the life of Christ to Balthasar's theology of the Trinity and its application to theodicy. I argue that Balthasar's interpersonal model of the Trinity as a life of communal self-giving love and Balthasar's grounding of the economy of salvation in the immanent Trinity provide the proper framework for answering the problem of evil from a Christian theological perspective. I conclude that human suffering, united to the Cross of Christ, becomes a participation in the life of the Triune God in a way that renders such suffering of great salvific value to the one who suffers and that thus justifies God's permission of innocent suffering. Finally, as a connection between Balthasar's work and American popular culture, I observe the trinitarian features of the response to the problem of evil found in William P. Young's recent best-selling novel The Shack and discover claims concerning the Trinity and theodicy that resonate deeply with the theology of Balthasar. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)",,,English,REVIEW

The broadcasting of vernacular culture will be shown to foster intimate and interactive relationships between broadcasters and audiences. Using a theoretical framework that draws upon the work of communications theorists Harold Innis and Walter Ong, the thesis will explore the (secondary) orality of radio broadcasting, and will consider instances in which the normative unidirectional structure and 'passive' orality of radio has been (and can be) made reciprocal and active through the participation of listeners. The inclusion of 'lay voices' and 'vernacular input' in radio broadcasting will be charted as a measure of the democratization of radio, and in order to demonstrate radio's role in disseminating oral history, promoting dialogue, and building and binding communities. The thesis will predominantly focus on local and regional forms of radio: the BBC Regions in the post-war era; regional radio programming serving the Canadianprovince ofNewfoundland both pre- and post-Confederation (which took place in 1949); and the community radio sector in the UK during the last five years. A common theme of many of the case studies within the thesis will be the role of citizen participation in challenging, transgressing or eroding editorial control, institutional protocols and the linguistic hegemony of radio production. Conversely, close attention will be given to the ways in which editorial control in radio production has circumscribed the self-definition of participants and communities. These case studies will provide evidence with which to investigate the following research question - is the democratization of radio possible through the incorporation of citizen voices or messages within radio production or programming, or is it only possible through changing the medium itself through citizen participation in democratic structures of production, management and ownership?.",,,English,REVIEW

Thus theology is rooted in spirituality as the experience of the covenant, of which it deepens the knowledge as a continuous reasoning moving around the two poles that are in constant relation: God and his people. Dedicated to the relationship spirituality has respectively with the Bible, dogma, eschatology, literature and sciences, the five parts of this thesis explore this elliptical movement of theological reasoning and pay special attention to interdisciplinary questions",,,French,REVIEW

His aesthetics privileges the cultural dimension compared to the edifying intentions : fragility of splendours, opposition between moderation and excessiveness. Concerning the spectacular teaching theatre because written in the Jesuit colleges, it also falls under a still recent tradition of a moral theatre intended for the representation. We study how this Jesuit Father, who taught rhetoric, took inspiration from topics and literary form to the ancient culture, and composed this corpus in the tradition of humanistic theatre, by combining tragedy with history, in rhetorical dimension which fulfils the requirements of Jesuit pedagogy. Although published by R. Rieks (Petrus Mussonius, Tragoediae, Peter Lang, Frankfurt am Main, 2000), these tragedies have never been translated, their ancient sources never thoroughly analysed, and their conditions of writing and performing never studied ; all these reasons justify this work about reception of historical figures and literary styles of Antiquity, under rhetoric influence.",,,French,REVIEW

Hans Urs von Balthasar (1905–1988) in presenting his Theo-Drama (1973–1983), by using the meditation of theatre as literary genre and as dramatic performance, clarifies the originality that is specific to the decisive christian understanding of time - the time of the life of Christ : a time definitive and fulfilled that is the model for a christian understandingof time. Time and history are clearly developed following the linear schema of before and after Jesus Christ but they are also envisaged as arranged around Christ as center.

Lonergan's trinitarian theology as it pertains to a systematic understanding of religious diversity. Renewed interest in trinitarian doctrine as the central Christian mystery with practical implications for theology and praxis as well as the key reality and concept in a coherent and ordered understanding of the Christian faith connects this doctrine with many areas of theology. In the current context of pluralism as fact, trinitarian theology provides the heuristic and hermeneutic to understand and appropriate the meaning of religious diversity in the life of the Church.|This dissertation is a systematic approach to the question of religious diversity. Thus, it presumes and affirms conciliar dogma (the Nicea-Constantinopolitan Creed) and theological doctrines (the psychological analogy for the Trinity). The ""unified field structure"" proposed by Robert M. Doran, which is comprised of Lonergan's four-point hypothesis coupled with a theory of history, serves as the theological framework and foundation toward an understanding of religious diversity that is open to and anticipates new developments that are bound to occur through the ongoing conversations between the world's religions.|I argue that a Lonerganian-trinitarian approach will result in a new set of questions elicited by the context of religious diversity different from the current debates circumscribed by Christocentric, ecclesiological and soteriological concerns. Such an approach will result in a shift in discourse from causality to that of meaning and a concomitant movement from the metaphysical language and categories of a theoretical theology to the language and categories of a methodical theology derived from intentionality analysis.|Lonergan‟s trinitarian thought and analysis of human development from above downward that are explored in this dissertation are two significant areas that remain underexploited and which, I believe, have great potential for any theological enterprise. Relevant to this topic is the experience, appropriation and meaning of the religious Other and the difference upon which diversity is predicated.

Deep within its theological roots were embedded two parallel streams of thought. One was the indigenous collective point of view regarding human sacrifice as perceived by the Náhua people of Mesoamerica, and the other was the western Christian perspective on the soteriological significance of atonement. This dissertation is an analysis of the theological tension that existed between these two dialectical points of view, and an explication of how this dialectical tension is resolved through Hans Urs von Balthasar's theology of Theo-Drama and Josiah Royce's notion of triadic relationships. I argue that the Passion Drama of Christ at the San Fernando Cathedral brings Von Balthasar's Theo-Drama to a theatrical expression and offers a dramatic Roycean interpretant which I call a theo-catharsis in which the Náhua and Western perspectives which would split a community apart instead become interpreted into a Beloved Community.",,,English,REVIEW

Through an online quantitative survey of administrators in centers of teaching and learning at Jesuit colleges and universities in the United States, this study examined the extent to which administrators are making available and appropriating Ignatian pedagogy and the contributions it might make to the current pedagogical literature for Jesuit higher education. It explored whether similar components within Ignatian pedagogy are fostered through other pedagogical approaches including, John Dewey's philosophy of education, critical pedagogy, feminist pedagogy, Service-Learning, adult learning theory, and Fink's taxonomy of significant learning. Results indicate the majority of administrators are very familiar with, and offer programs on, Ignatian pedagogy. They unanimously care for the Jesuit mission and nearly all believe in providing pedagogical resources that foster the Jesuit mission. The literature review identified connections between Ignatian pedagogy and several pedagogical approaches while administrators' made the majority of connections between Ignatian pedagogy and Service-Learning and Adult Learning. More than three-fourths administrators promote three Ignatian teaching methodological elements, Context, Experience, and Reflection, while more than one-half promote the element Action. Greater than two-thirds provide programs that foster the development of the whole person, service to others, and social justicecore Jesuit values. Further, more than three-fourths of Center administrators believe Ignatian pedagogy is viable for higher education. These results positively affirm the validity and viability of Ignatian pedagogy, a nearly 500 year-old Jesuit educational tradition and way of proceeding, in light of 21st century higher education pedagogical knowledge and practices. Recommendations include: increasing faculty knowledge of, accessibility to, and opportunities for critique and debate of, Ignatian pedagogy; expanding student evaluation to incorporate maturation and moral growth; and expanding pedagogical practices to include spiritual development.

Working in the aftermath of the Council of Trent, these priests sought to establish a Roman Catholic identity for their parishioners while living and working in the midst of Protestants, Anabaptists, Hussites, and Jews. Anabaptists in particular found patronage under local Moravian lords willing to tolerate them for a number of reasons, including economic utility and personal conviction. An examination of the writings of Erhard and Fischer reveals a number of issues that permeated the course of Catholic counter-reform in this area of confessional pluralism. For in the absence of support from their overlords, these priests had to rely heavily on persuasive strategies in their published polemics. They drew upon a genealogy of heresy grounded in the history of the Roman Church, sought to trouble the|consciences of those lords who tolerated confessional pluralism in their domains, and promoted public Roman Catholic ritual practices, especially Eucharistic devotion through the annual Feast of Corpus Christi. Their work serves as an excellent point of departure for understanding how representatives of the Roman Church approached the problem of heresy in the Holy Roman Empire in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, especially in regions where the Church lacked the full support of local and regional secular authorities.",,,English,REVIEW

Yet, Henri IV's recantation put an end to the English passion for Huguenot victories, even though they remained interested in French history books.

Secondly, the short-term goal of collaboration with the S. J. was challenged and a new concept of relationship with the Jesuits was embraced by most of the group members. Thirdly, the method employed has shown its usefulness to study action groups in a short period of time. Time and cost are two factors recommending this method.

Specifically, the project interrogates the Franciscan propagation of miracle-working objects--from the championing of popular Marian images in the seventeenth century to the crafting of potent sculptures and their dissemination in the eighteenth--and attempts to relate these activities to the socio-political and religious landscape of late colonial New Spain. Thus, the Franciscan advancement of numinous objects, seldom the focus of concentrated study, is here minutely examined and historically contextualized.|The Order's early investment in images--namely, the didactic image--was central to the sixteenth-century Franciscan missionary project. Yet while this period is traditionally seen as one in which the mendicant order rejected the concept of thaumaturgic objects--reticence towards the Virgin of Guadalupe is traditionally emphasized--the study argues for a more nuanced reading of the historical sources. Rather than define the late colonial Franciscan support of miraculous images as a break from sixteenth-century restraint, the current project chooses instead to understand how the Order's earliest strategies concerning images and their use set the stage for the future investment in numinous objects.|The dissertation interrogates the first Franciscan written accounts and activities that advanced the reputation of numinous, sacred objects and the Order's official attachment to sanctuary sites. Iconophilic praxis is examined in relationship to the onslaught of challenges posed by mendicant rivals--the Jesuits chief among them--and the Spanish Crown's own seventeenth-century strategy of transferring economic, religious, and political clout from monastic centers to the secular Church. The Crown's sharp and unforgiving policies would greatly intensify in the eighteenth century and culminate in the nineteenth. The same period, however, sees the establishment of the Franciscan missionary colleges of Propaganda Fide.|For Franciscan friars working under the banner of Propaganda Fide, spiritual reparation, religious renovation, and moral restitution formed a lexicon aimed at sustaining long-term projects of instauration. The late colonial promotion of sacred images became crucial to a buoyant Franciscan ontology: miraculous images reconverted lapsed communities, spiritually renovated ailing cities, battled Devils in Christian bodies, and announced mendicant piety and sanctity. Missionaries carefully sought to create and control a local cult of images in areas such as Queretaro, Zacatecas, Upper California, and Texas. The symbiotic relationship between the eighteenth-century missionary enterprise and the miraculous icon is most apparent in the history of a Marian icon from el Pueblito (Queretaro). Although the image's central iconography originates in a Rubens oil-sketch celebrating the Immaculate Conception, the visual theme receives the most exposure in the Franciscan strongholds of central New Spain where it comes to be strictly identified with the Order's conversion efforts. Thus, what began as an illustration of a controversial doctrine and its royal support in the Spanish Netherlands became, in Spanish America, a laudatory statement on the Franciscan missionary project. Yet the microhistory of the Virgin of el Pueblito also demonstrates the friars' strategy for the transformation of an illustration into a religious presence; in the town of el Pueblito, the Marian sculpture became an instrument capable of conversion, a holy image, and an object of veneration. With the story of el Pueblito, the dissertation enters into a more historical discussion of the status of images in the New World and interrogates the process through which an image came not only to symbolize something new, but to do something different.",,,English,REVIEW

My project aims at achieving a triadic structured thesis. It is about a: 1) historical ; 2)critical and 3) reflexive perspective. The historical perspective consists in a diachronic analysis,in trying to grasp the novelty of the Suarezian moment in scholastic metaphysics. The critical perspective allows me to analyze properly the metaphysical system elaborated by Suarez, at the same time trying to interpret the unpublished elements proposed by the Jesuit in Disputationes Metaphysicae. The reflexive perspective consists in problematizing the Suarezian project in the light ofthe Byzantine theology. The leading wire is represented by the analogy.Through this thesis, I wanted to have the opportunity to say what is won and what is lostonce with ""the F. Suarez moment"".",,,French,REVIEW

I investigate the various ways in which worship within the Gesù employed sense perception as a method of facilitating devotion. In this vein, the use of preaching, visual arts, architecture, and music individually and collectively demonstrate that Jesuits were keenly aware that stimulating the senses would result in a more emotional and mystical form of devotion. For this investigation, the original sacristy manual of the Gesù is employed to reconstruct the liturgy. Linking this to sense perception, the long-standing tradition of the application of the senses within the Society of Jesus is explored. Also, this thesis analyzes how this tradition created a uniquely Ignatian liturgy in the Gesù that, while conforming with the Tridentine Church, was grounded in Ignatius’ beliefs that one could come closer to the divine through the senses.",,,English,REVIEW

F., 1904–1984","This dissertation is a comparative study of spiritual cultivation in Early Daoism and the spiritual teaching of Augustine's Christianity. My goal is to examine how early Daoism's founder, Laozi, and the Christian bishop, Augustine of Hippo, characterize the fulfillment of humanity through religious transformation. My argument is that the metaphysical speculations that figure in their works---and which scholarly readers often emphasize---are offshoots of profound practical, soteriological concerns. These soteriological concerns reveal that the primary interest for both writers was to discover those spiritual and intellectual practices that could most effectively mediate between human experience and the manifestation of transcendent order. This study takes its inspiration from pioneering instances of comparative theology (particularly works by Francis Clooney S.J. and Lee Yearly), and focuses on the cross-reading of texts. For Laozi, the basic text used in this study is. For Augustine, the primary text is de Trinitate, with some Daode Jing closely related writings. Both texts play similar formative roles in their respective religious traditions. My methodology also makes heuristic use of Bernard Lonergan's study of the fourfold operation of human consciousness as experience, understanding, judgment and decision. This general description of human consciousness is a useful framework to draw out similarities and differences in these texts. The primary thematic interest of the thesis is ethical. I explore how early Daoism and Augustine's Christianity were both animated by the concern to confront human violence through spiritual exercises and the renewal of authentic humanity. In comparing Daode Jing and de Triniate, I consider the ways that each author's encounter with social violence shaped their intellectual projects. Laozi and Augustine's search for transcendent order was motivated by the hope of overcoming disordered human desires. This task required an understanding of human participation in transcendent order which could be realized in direct realms of experience, through knowledge of the operations of interior consciousness and the practice of daily spiritual exercises. Though both thinkers are often treated in dogmatic or philosophical terms, their primary interest was in practical spirituality, a way of living. Both Laozi and Augustine searched for `the Way"" for disciples of their respective traditions to nurture personal life and to maintain hope as a religious community in a turbulent world. These issues are dealt with in four chapters. In Chapter One I develop my theoretical framework and the categories of the hermeneutics of consciousness. In Chapter Two I reconstruct the political-religious context of Chinese culture that the author of Daode Jing criticized . Against this context, I then explain in Chapter Three Laozi's major insights into the nature of transcendent order, particularly his understanding of its character as Three in One (Self-so, Nothing and Something), specified in Daode Jing. In Chapter Four I expound Augustine's development of the doctrine of the Trinity as the fundamental signature of divine reality, which is also reflected in the structure of human subjectivity. This leads to Chapter Five where I consider these two views as dialogical partners and advance the view that a juxtapositional reading of these two texts leads to new insights through the way that each can be said to develop a distinctive interpretation of the concept ""effortless action.""",,,English,REVIEW

Sie möchte untersuchen, wie Karl Rahner (1904–1984), einer der einflussreichsten katholischen Theologen des 20. Jahrhunderts und ein Mann der offenen Augen, dieses Problem in seinen Schriften behandelt.|Das Theodizee-Thema entzieht sich bei Rahner in den meisten Fällen und wurde deshalb in der Sekundärliteratur bislang allenfalls am Rande gestreift, jedoch nicht ausführlich – mit Bezug auf einschlägige Textstellen – behandelt. Auch nach den Gründen, warum Rahner sich kaum dazu geäußert hat, wurde noch nicht eingehender gefragt. Diese Lücke möchte die Arbeit schließen.|Um einen Zugang zu Rahners Werk zu finden, wurde eine Stichwortsuche durchgeführt und die gefundenen Textstellen auf ihre Relevanz hin analysiert. Zunächst wurde dabei in allgemeiner Form nach der Theodizee-Thematik gefragt. Im zweiten Schritt wurde der Tatsache Rechnung getragen, dass Rahner seine Schriften zum großen Teil „nach Auschwitz“ verfasst hat, als sich die Theodizeefrage in verschärfter Form neu stellte. In besonderer Weise wurde Rahners Aufsatz „Warum läßt uns Gott leiden?“ berücksichtigt.|Es fällt auf, dass Rahner insbesondere das Problem des Bösen beschäftigt. Wenn er auch die Rückfrage an Gott offenhält, wehrt er sich doch im Sinne Augustins und in Frontstellung gegenüber Tendenzen seiner Zeit, das Phänomen der Schuld zu unterschlagen, dagegen, den Menschen aus der Verantwortung zu entlassen. Tendenziell ist eine Reduktion der Frage auf eine Theodizee des je eigenen Todes zu beobachten, was Rahners transzendentaltheologischem Ansatz geschuldet sein dürfte. Danach ist der Mensch grundsätzlich dazu aufgefordert, sich dem unbegreiflichen Geheimnis seines Daseins anzuvertrauen. Insofern hat Theodizee nichtbegreifend, in Glaube, Hoffnung und Liebe zu geschehen. Auschwitz bedeutet nach Rahner eine fundamentale Erschütterung des Gottesglaubens, der aber – gerade im Blick auf die Opfer der Geschichte – ein Gebot der Nächstenliebe bleibt, bietet er doch eine Perspektive der Hoffnung.||This thesis deals with the question of God that is central to theology, more particularly with the vital question of God and human suffering. Its purpose is to analyze the way in which Karl Rahner (1904–1984), one of the most influential theologians of the 20th century and a man with eyes wide open on things, treats this problem in his writing.|In Rahner the topic of theodicy is difficult to grasp in most cases and has therefore been dealt with – if at all – in a marginal way in secondary literature; but it has never been treated in any depth and with direct reference to pertinent text passages. Furthermore, the reasons why Rahner hardly ever dealt with the subject explicitly have not yet been focused on. This thesis means to close this gap.|In order to approach Rahner’s work a keyword search has been made and the references found have been analyzed with regard to their relevance. During a first approach the question of the theodicy topic was asked more generally. In a second step it was taken into account that Rahner wrote most of his works “after Auschwitz” when the question of theodicy was put anew and more poignantly. Particular consideration was given to Rahner’s essay “Why does God allow us to suffer?”.|Obviously the problem of evil is his main concern. Even though he admits the reproachful question to God, he follows Augustine and is in opposition to tendencies of his time that reject the phenomenon of guilt, when he refuses to relieve man from personal responsibility. There seems to be a tendency to reduce the question to a theodicy of individual death; this may be due to Rahner’s transcendental-theological approach. According to this approach man is principally asked to have confidence in the incomprehensible mystery of his existence. Insofar theodicy has to come about – non-comprehendingly – in faith, hope and love.|As to Rahner, Auschwitz marks a fundamental challenge to the belief in God, which remains however – especially with regard to the victims of history – a commandment of brotherly love, offering a perspective of hope.",Institut für Systematische Theologie,,German,REVIEW

Les vastes espaces septentrionaux se consolidèrent alors comme des régions de frontière: les plus lointaines étaient à peine explorées, celles situées plus près des centres de colonisation furent progressivement, mais de manière précaire, intégrées à la monarchie. Au cours du siècle, les missionnaires, notamment franciscains et jésuites, jouèrent un rôle très actif dans le processus d’appropriation de ces marges : en tant qu’explorateurs, évangélisateurs et colonisateurs au service du roi, ils s’insérèrent graduellement dans les espaces du septentrion. Tout d’abord, il fut nécessaire d’imaginer les contrées qui restaient inconnues – la Californie, le Nouveau Mexique : à partir d’une amalgame de mythes et de savoirs à la double origine, européenne et indienne, les religieux dressèrent des cartes et des rapports représentant ces régions convoitées. Avec le passage du temps, la composante américaine desdites représentations s’accentua. Parallèlement, pendant le processus d'incorporation de la Nouvelle-Biscaye, la Compagnie de Jésus y articula un réseau de missions afin de christianiser-« civiliser » les populations et d’occuper les territoires toujours réfractaires à la conquête. Les religieux durent ainsi adapter leurs stratégies d’appropriation aux caractéristiques de l’espace. Enfin, les frontières du Nord génèrent des conditions de vie difficiles pour les missionnaires qui furent parfois découragés de leur travail et conduits vers des comportements peu orthodoxes du point de vue religieux.| |In the XVIIth century, the conquering advance of Spaniards was met by resistance from territories and men in the north of New Spain. The vast septentrional reaches were then consolidated as frontier regions, as the most remote areas were barely explored, while regions located closer to settlement centers were progressively, yet precariously, integrated to monarchy. In the course of the century, missionaries, especially Franciscans and Jesuits, played a very active role in the appropriation process of border regions. As explorers, evangelists and colonizers for the King of Spain, they gradually settled in the septentrional regions. At first, it was necessary to imagine unknown reaches: California, New Mexico. Picking from a set of myths and knowledge with a dual – European and Native American – origin, the priests drew up maps and reports of the coveted areas. As time passed, representations showed increased American influence. In parallel, as integration of New Biscay progressed, the Company of Jesus articulated a network of missions with the objective to christianize – “civilize” – populations and occupy the territories that resisted conquest. The missionaries had to adapt their appropriation strategies to land characteristics. Finally, missionaries had to face difficult life conditions at the northern frontiers, and were at times disheartened in their work and lapsed into rather unorthodox behaviors from a religious point of view.",,,French,REVIEW

Si le poète est de culture jésuite, le recueil, cependant, atteste en poésie une veine augustinienne en dehors de Port-Royal, liée au milieu spirituel normand de l'époque et à l'influence des oratoriens augustiniens. Brébeuf, réussit une double synthèse. Il parvient à faire coïncider dans la poétique de la méditation une grande partie du protocole et des processus mentaux issus de la spiritualité jésuite avec un fonds augustinien austère et pessimiste, puisé à la fois à la source des Confessions et dans la tradition augustinienne. Brébeuf réussit, par ailleurs, à concilier les principes d'une esthétique mondaine avec la dénonciation des vanités du monde et la volonté de conduire son lecteur, à travers une instance d'énonciation fluctuante et labile, à la pénitence et à la conversion. Les Entretiens solitaires s'affichent comme une vanité littéraire dont les stratégies rhétoriques sont destinées à toucher le lecteur et à faire céder le bastion de son amour-propre pour creuser en lui une capacité susceptible d'être habitée par la grâce de Dieu. Le recueil des Entretiens solitaires, entre baroque et classicisme, aura été l'occasion d'un divertissement pieux qui, en alternant les chants de la Grâce et du Néant, prépare un horizon de conversion, dans un au-delà du texte insaisissable.||Famous in the 1650s, for his gallant and heroic verses, the poet native from Normandy, Georges de Brébeuf, publishes the Solitary Conversations or the Prayers and the meditations in verse French in 1660. Although he belongs to the Jesuit culture, the Solitary Conversations attest in poetry an augustinian vein out of Port-Royal poetry, due to the influence of the Norman spiritual environment and the preponderant part of augustinian oratorians. Brébeuf succeeded in a double synthesis. He made coincide, in the poetics of meditation, a large part of the protocol and the mental processes of Jesuit spirituality with an austere and pessimistic augustinian content, drawn both from the Confessions of Augustine and the augustinian tradition. Moreover, Brébeuf managed to reconcile the principles of worldly aesthetics, with the denunciation of vanities of the world and the will to lead his reader, through a fluctuating and unstable subject of enunciation, to penance and conversion. The Solitary Conversations can really be considered as a literary Vanity which uses some rhetorical strategies to move the reader and to break the bastion of his self-esteem. Once the intimate space became empty of sinner's ""ego"", the divine Grace can fill back this pure capacity. The Solitary Conversations, between baroque and classicism, may have been, for the readers, the occasion of a pious entertainment and, by alternating the songs of the Grace and the Nothingness, may have prepared their conversion, beyond the text.

The beginning of this renewal is marked by the work of Karl Rahner who, before the Second Vatican Council, decried the fact that Roman Catholicism, in contrast to the Protestant theological tradition, lacked an adequate theology of the word. Relying on a Roman Catholic theology of grace, Rahner's work, along with that of sacramental theologian Louis-Marie Chauvet, demonstrates the Roman Catholic conviction that the word is fundamentally sacramental: it has the capacity to bear God's presence to humanity.|This dissertation examines the contributions of Rahner and Chauvet, contextualizing them within the larger Christian tradition, and identifying ways in which their contributions advanced a Roman Catholic theology of the word. To that end, the first chapter describes the twentieth-century context. The second chapter treats classical sacramental theology: the work of Augustine and Thomas Aquinas. Here words are identified as types of signs, and similarities between classical approaches to God's revelation found in scripture and in the sacraments are demonstrated. The third chapter considers the work of Reformation theologians Martin Luther and John Calvin. These figures emphasize that the scriptural word is also the sacramental word of promise; they grapple with the necessity of material elements to mediate God's grace in a fallen world. The fourth chapter examines Rahner's efforts to demonstrate the relationship between word and sacrament by contextualizing them within an understanding of an already graced world in which language is the privileged place of the self-expression of God. The fifth chapter examines Chauvet's work, focusing on the sacramentality of language, culture, and creation, yet emphasizing the radical absence of the body of the Risen Christ. Christians are formed by the word into the body of Christ through participation in liturgy and maintenance of a sacramental world. The conclusion compares these approaches, and analyzes their implications for Trinitarian theology, sacramentality, and the understanding of the relationship between word and sacrament. It suggests that the principle of sacramentality is a necessary consideration for Roman Catholic theologies of the word.",,,English,KEEP

In the Epic panels, Benton employed stylized black, white, and Indian bodies to challenge conventional accounts of American history and expectations for mural painting. With their strangely elongated bodies, exaggerated proportions, distorted physical features, and intensely sculptural presence, Benton's monumental figures are powerful formal inventions but also startlingly and unmistakably American. Benton sought to interrogate the nation's art and body politic visually and thematically at a moment when problems of racial and national identity dominated political and cultural discourse. Politically motivated, the Epic is integrally related to the racially charged citizenship debates of the late 1910s and early 1920s. Yet the specific histories, art histories, and cultural references embedded in the iconography of the murals and associated with its figures and forms have never been analyzed in their entirety, until now. Discovery, Palisades, Aggression, Prayer, Retribution, Clearing the Land, Planting, The Slaves, The Witch, The Pathfinder, Over the Mountain, Jesuits, Struggle for the Wilderness, Lost Hunting Ground: these are the titles of the fourteen publicly exhibited Epic panels. The titles hint at their content, but it is the black, white, and Indian figures that reveal Benton's re-thinking of American history and the role of race within it. The nation's most familiar historical themes--discovery, religion, westward expansion--are recast to confront the racial inequities and violence embedded in the popular experience of these histories. This dissertation examines the Epic's provocative elements, from the unheroic subject matter to Benton's treatment of form, space, and design, and their influence on the ""failure"" of the mural series; after almost a decade of work, Benton had not received a public commission and abandoned the project. Consequently, Benton's artistic methods, idiosyncratic stylistic borrowings, and ambiguous use of racial figures are considered in relation to his own ambitions for these works as well as to the Epic 's anomalous status within the history of American art.",,,English,REVIEW

In the 1670’s during his training at the ‘Manufacture des Gobelins’ he worked under the supervision of Charles Le Brun and met the minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert. In 1677 he joined the French Academy in Rome where he carved garden sculptures for royal estates and for his protector Colbert. Early in his Roman carrier he was made member of the Academy of St Luke and member of the Congregazione dei Virtuosi al Pantheon where he met Bernini, the architect Carlo Fontana and the painter Carlo Maratta. Appreciated by the Pope Innocent XII he obtained several commissions at Saint-Peter’s (Baptismal chapel, Monument to Christine of Sweden) and at the same time he worked for the Jesuits at the Sant’Ignazio chapel at the Gesù. As one of the most significant sculptors of the end of the Roman Seicento he dedicated his last years in Rome to the pope Clement XI and the papal basilica before his return to Paris in 1705 where he worked for the Sun King and the ‘Maisons’ of Meudon and Marly. With the same maestria Jean-Baptiste Théodon carved allegories for Colbert, mythological and historical figures for Louis XIV, funeral sculptures and portrait for Christine of Sweden as well as works of art for Roman churches. The Ph.D. dissertation consists of a study of the career of the sculptor with an analysis of his artistic manner and its evolution from Paris to Rome. In addition the thesis includes the complete ‘catalogue raisonné’ of his works, sculptures and drawings.",Titre provenant de l'écran-titre. - Thèse confidentielle jusqu'au 05 décembre 2013,,French,REVIEW

It argues that the contemplative works of Ignatius of Loyola and Teresa of Avila support a reading of Christ's death and resurrection as an allegory of the image's awakening in a scenario of damage, and that Catholicism's response to the Protestant rejection of the soteriological efficacy of works rests on the hermeneutic possibilities inscribed in it. The image's awakening is shown to disclose a limit whose overcoming acts as a foundation of the salutary action of institutions, particularly that of religious orders like the Jesuit and the Discalced Carmelite orders. Focusing on the Jesuit construction of the institution as a tool gripped by the hand of God, the first half of the dissertation proposes to think of efficacy in terms of the discovery of an apostolic mandate in the void opened by the image's dissipation. I explore the performance of this dissipation (an echo of Christ's disappearance from the world in the Ascension) in the prescriptions for the election of a new leader laid out in the order's Constitutions and in the schema for the Election that the Spiritual Exercises, Ignatius' manual of contemplation, lodge at their core. The second half, an extended reading of The Interior Castle, juxtaposes the Jesuit performance of this dissipation with Teresa's efforts to secure the image's persistence. The delay that afflicts the image's dissipation, as well as the passage to efficacy, is referred to Teresa's statements on the ""inconvenience"" of Christ's disappearance, and then linked to the growing relevance of the category of beauty in the praxis of the Discalced Carmelite order. Shifting the focus away from the iconoclastic polemic, The Theurgic Image considers the relation between image and institution to revolve around the possibility of a praxis which, resisting the autonomization of action implicit in the Protestant doctrine of sola fide, would be endowed with a transcendental foundation. In its movement towards a consideration of beauty, it argues for the problematization of this praxis and of the institutions that embody it as the site of a prophetic articulation of the distinctly modern differentiation between technics and art.",,,English,REVIEW

Nous devons faire une mention particulière au décryptage des inventaires de temporalidades, rédigés après l'expulsion de l'Ordre en 1767, trouvés aux Archives Nationales du Chili. Ce décryptage permettra de montrer pour la première fois le contenu des bibliothèques jésuites chilienne. La question de savoir qui était l'utilisateur et qui le lecteur dans ces bibliothèques m'a conduit à m'interroger sur la condition individuelle du lecteur qui apparaissait dans les textes théoriques analysés, et à développer un point de vue nouveau autour des réflexions sur les travaux des auteurs les plus importants pour le développement de ce champ de recherche. Le lecteur qui est visé par notre recherche ne s'agit pas d'un individu parce que dans chaque collège jésuite habitait un ensemble de membres de l'Ordre, qui suivaient les mêmes principes et les mêmes normes de vie et qui se formaient en pratiquant les Exercices Spirituels d'Ignace de Loyola et à travers le contenu du Ratio studiorum, grâce auxquels ils apprenaient à lire et à écrire d'une manière particulière et en étant encadrés par les Constitutions et par la Règle de l'Ordre. Ces caractéristiques m'ont fait voir les évidences empiriques qui justifient la construction d'une notion qui puisse expliquer la pratique de la lecture d'une organisation. Ainsi a émergé l'idée du "" lecteur collectif "". L'enquête est délimitée par un question directrice qui vise la recherche d'une explication pour comprendre le rôle de la lecture et des livres dans la constitution de l'identité à caractère savant. Autrement dit, comment une organisation devient un lecteur collectif, et en même temps, comment cette condition de lecteur collectif marque son identité.||Three main subjects underlie our research : firts, the questions around the reader and the practice of reading; second, the Jesuit Order as an institution dealing with knoxledge and culture; third and finally the libraries that the Jesuits created and owned the WVI and XVIII centuries. On the libraries, it deserves special mention the original transcritpion and deciphering of the manuscripts of 'temporalidades "", drafted after the expulsion of the Jesuits from the domains of the Spanish Crown that I found in the National Archives of Chile. The question of knowing who was the user and who was the reader in these libraries, lead me naturally to question the individual nature of "" the reader "" in the theoritical texts and analyzed and to develop a reinterpretation of this theoritical corpus. The reader in our research is not an individual. In each Jesuit College lived a group of members of the order that had access to the libraries. They had been formed practicing Ignace de Loyola's Spiritual Exercises, followed the same principles and norms of life and through the contents of the ratio Studiorum, they learned to read and write in a particular wa. These features of the Jesuit Order provided me with empirical evidence underlying the construction of a notion that could explain the practice of reading in an organization. In this way that the idea of a "" collective reader "" emerges. The domain of research is delimited by a key guiding question that demands the search for answers to understand the role of reading and of books in the constitution of the identity of an institution of knowledge. In other words, how an organization transfoms itself into a "" collective reader "", and at the same time, how this condition of being a collective.",,,French,REVIEW

The various cultures of the world are far more accessible than ever before, and people are more mobile and more likely to traverse into cultures different than their own. The dissertation is focused on the intercultural encounters between China and Europe during the late Ming (1368–1644) and early Qing (1644–1911) dynasties. It was a time when merchandise traders and religious groups from Europe traveled into China as merchants and Jesuit missionaries in significant numbers. Although many different kinds of events took place between the Chinese and the Europeans in various disciplines, this research is focused on examination of visual art and architecture as evidence of intercultural contact between Europe and China during the Jesuit mission in China. The realm of art provides an informative example of this series of encounters between the Chinese and the Europeans. Art is a visible form; it is tangible and it conveys evidence of cultural encounters. The same could be said of architecture, another kind of art form. The purpose of this dissertation is to study and analyze these cultural encounters which are embodied in visual art and architecture. This is a research of intercultural communication between China and Europe through the Jesuit missionaries' experience. It aims to explain how and why each of the Chinese and European societies was able to communicate culturally with each other in respect of utter differences in form, content and meaning of visual art and architecture. It is interesting to find out how the two cultures could transform the differences acceptable to each other's culture. To accomplish this goal, this dissertation adopts the documentary research methodology by using several historical sources that include art forms, historical knowledge and critical commentaries by other scholars. The intercultural encounters mirrored through the experience of Jesuit missionaries are discussed throughout the dissertation.",,,English,REVIEW

Christ's childlikeness before the Father is both the means by which Christ reveals the beauty of divinity and is the revelation of divinity as absolute Love. Absolute Love shows itself in powerless, formless obedience which is chosen in absolute freedom. Such love holds in tension sovereign authority with dependent poverty. In such an existence is seen the majestic beauty of the divine simplicity of Trinitarian life. By Love's powerless power, the eschatological beauty of redeemed humanity united with God is brought about in Christ's one body.

Specifically the research focuses on 17th and 18th century Jesuit missionary activity of the Yaqui and Tarahumara regions of Northwest New Spain, which corresponds with modern day Mexican states of Chihuahua and Sonora. It argues that within colonial Latin America, religious missions were a reciprocal affair in which no one remained passive during the encounter. Instead, the foundation of missions initiated a process of cultural exchange in which natives were able to negotiate which practices would remain, be transformed, or be introduced to mission life. Indigenous populations chose to at times accept and at others to reject the Jesuit missionary project. By resisting or selectively accepting conversion, indigenous people were contributing to shape hybrid religious practices within the missions, and consequently, managed to exercise some control over the impact of the Jesuit presence had upon their cultural practices.||Primary sources include documents such as letters and correspondence of active Jesuit missionaries within Northern New Spain, traveler’s accounts, Spanish royal decrees, and the Constitution of the Society of Jesus.

People who have been subjected to extreme suffering frequently find that their usual modes of self-experience and of relating to the world have been stripped away. They experience agitation and restlessness. They are exposed to a mysterious and disturbing void at the core of their being and a profound existential selfquestion arises from that experience. Existential concerns have been addressed throughout the ages, engaging as they do both an interior experience of mystery and an ensuing selfquestion. Hans Urs von Balthasar explores these dynamics and articulates the self-question as ""Who am I?"" Another to address these issues is Bernard Lonergan who asks what it is to ""be oneself."" For Balthasar the question is answered only by the discovery of one's Godgiven vocation and mission. For Lonergan the question is answered by the authentic exercise of one's capacity for self-transcendence. Ultimately, I suggest, both approaches are complementary.' - (Abstract) 'This study contributes to the development of a theological phenomenology of vocation. In so doing, it posits that the distressing condition of existential unrest can be a foundational motivation for the vocational search and argues that the discovery of one's vocation, which necessarily entails an engagement with existential mystery, is served by attentiveness to what is termed the ""pneumo-somatic"" data of embodied consciousness. Hence, the study does not canvass the broad range of phenomena that would contribute to a comprehensive phenomenology of vocation. Rather, it seeks to highlight an aspect frequently overlooked in the vocational search, namely the value of attentiveness to one's experience of the body in the context of prayerful engagement with the mystery of God.'",,,English,REVIEW

Elle néglige la littérature et la relation biographique ancienne qui unit le théologien aux oeuvres littéraires. Le théologien n'a pas pour autant dressé d'autre cadre que celui de l'esthétique théologique pour penser cette relation. Le but de cette étude est d'en reconstruire de l'intérieur les principaux motifs afin de saisir l'apport originel de l'oeuvre littéraire. Il est nécessaire de prendre la mesure du corpus littéraire au coeur de la Trilogie, ses racines et sa logique propre. L'oeuvre littéraire fournit d'abord par son déploiement une couleur consistante à l'esthétique théologique par le travail du style littéraire éloignant la foi chrétienne d'un platonisme désincarné. Se jouant du fond et de la forme, le style devient aussi un principe discriminant pour établir la réelle marge de manoeuvre qui est laissée au texte littéraire et permet d'échapper au soupçon de récupération. L'insistance sur la singularité des figures est aussi un gage de liberté laissée au texte littéraire. En exposant la conception catholique de la grâce et de la nature, Balthasar noue les relations entre la pensée humaine et l'inouï de la révélation, tout en tenant un christocentrisme qui lui est cher. La lecture balthasarienne est alors théologique. Elle vise à discerner en chacun des auteurs l'élément chrétien qui éclaire l'unique figure du Christ. Chacun des auteurs le fait à sa manière et avec richesse faisant droit à une véritable anthropologie comprise par Balthasar sous l'angle de la mission. La catégorie de sacrement utilisés sous une acceptation élargie assigne ainsi aux réalités terrestres et aux mots un poids inédit : reconnus capables de dire le mystère de l'Etre et en définitive de Dieu.| |The study of the sources of the Balthasarian theology often focuses on both the contribution of philosophy and patristics in the Trilogy. It neglects literature and the old biographical relationship between the theologian and literary works. The theologian has nevertheless not drawn up another framework than that of theological aesthetic to think out this relationship. The aim of this study is to rebuild the main pattern from the inside in order to grasp the original contribution of the literary work. It is necessary to get the mesure of the literary corpus at the heart of the Trilogy with its own roots and logic. The literary work first gives a substantial color to theological aesthetic through its spreading out, thanks to the work on the literary style by moving away the christian creed from disembodied platonism. By making a mockery of form and content, the style also becomes a discriminating principle to establish a real room for negotiation which is let to the literary text and grants the escape from the suspicion of exploitation. The insistence on the peculiarity of the figures is also a guarantee of freedom let to the literary text. By explosing the catholic conception of grace and of nature, Balthasar binds the human thought to the incredibility of Revelation as well as he keeps a christocentrism which he holds dear. Thus the balthasarian reading is theological. It aims at discerning in each author the christian element which sheds light on the unique figure of Christ. Each author does it in his own way and with rechness giving its right to a real anthropology understood by Balthasar from the angle of mission. The sacrament category used as an enlarged meaning allots a new weight to terrestrial realities and to words - both are recognized as being able to tell the mystery of the being and finally of God.",,,French,REVIEW

Chapter 1 provides an historical survey of the political and legal controversies concerning religious belief and practice from Henry VIII's creation of the royal supremacy (1533–1534) to Elizabeth's final year as queen (1603). Chapters 2 through 5 comprise four case studies, each of which centres on a play or pageant about the Tudor royals and its relationship to one of the aforementioned events. Chapters 2 and 3 examine Thomas Heywood's If You Know Not Me, You Know No Bodie (1604) and Samuel Rowley's When You See Me, You Know Me (1604), dramatizations of Elizabeth's years as princess and the later years of Henry VIII's reign respectively, in light of the puritan campaigns for church reform and religious toleration surrounding the Hampton Court Conference. Chapter 4 examines the uses of the Tudors in Thomas Dekker's The Magnificent Entertainment, a detailed account of James's royal entry of March 1604. In particular, I focus on the London-Dutch community's celebration of Tudor religious and economic commitments to the Protestant Low Countries in relation to the early Stuart negotiations for an end to the Anglo-Spanish war. Chapter 5 discusses Thomas Dekker's allegorical rendering of the later decades of Elizabeth's reign, The Whore of Babylon (1607), as a commentary on the Stuart government's response to Jesuit insurgency following the Gunpowder Plot. In order to situate these plays and pageants in their precise contexts, each of the four case studies incorporates a variety of historical evidence ranging from royal proclamations to religious polemics, from stories of martyrdom to state trials. This thesis offers a topical reading of play and pageantry in which the Tudor past engages with the seminal political-religious issues and controversies of early Stuart England.",,,English,REVIEW

This study will explore and analyze the lives and thoughts of four Chilean priests who were deeply concerned with the Social Question: Mariano Casanova (1833–1908), Archbishop of Santiago between 1886 and 1908; Juan Ignacio González (1844–1918), Archbishop of Santiago between 1908 and 1918; Martín Rücker (1867–1935), Bishop of Chillán between 1923 and 1935; and the Jesuit Fernando Vives (1871–1935), who, although he was never appointed to a higher level of the ecclesiastical hierarchy, had a polemical role in public opinion about the Social question that cost him two long exiles. The argument of this report is that between 1891 and 1935 the Chilean Catholic thought about the Social Question had changes and continuities. Among the first, there are the change of the focus of catholic action from charity to justice, or about the role of the State. The permanencies had to do with the traditional concept that the Catholic Church held, despite its efforts for having a more active role in the modern world. The main examples are the paternalistic attitude towards the workers and the consequent rejection of social mobility. The condition of the poor could be improved, but they always, and their children, would belong to the working class. It was a hierarchical vision of a class society. This contradiction, finally, explains why one of the main purposes of the Catholic social teaching did not succeed: stopping the spread of socialism. Even more, although it had an active goal about the Social Question, the Catholic Church could not stop secularization either.",,,English,REVIEW

The afrochoteños are the direct descendents of enslaved Africans brought to the region by Jesuits to labor the local sugar-cane plantations during the seventeenth century. Their particular history, cultural traditions, beliefs, customs, and ways of life distinguish them from Ecuador's indigenous, mestizo, and coastal black population. Despite their contribution to the nation's development and identity as a pluri-cultural state, the afrochotẽos face extreme social, political, and economic marginalization as a result of their displacement and origins with the trans-Atlantic slave trade, subjugation and oppression as slaves, uneven integration, and continued exploitation and discrimination post emancipation. As such, the afrochoteños are made invisible in representations of the nation's history and culture, save only for their presence on the national soccer team. While academic interest in topics concerning Afro-Hispanic and Afro-Andean communities is growing, much work remains in not only documenting, but critically exploring these subaltern histories and traditions in terms of the stories of oppression, struggle, resistance, and hope they tell. I thus examine the afrochoteño song and dance genre known as La Bomba in relation to the socio-historical development and struggles of the afrochoteño communities as a means of illuminating afrochoteño culture and their condition as subalterns. Though marginalized for much of the twentieth century, La Bomba is today recognized nationally as a symbol of afrochoteño identity thanks in part to a revival spurred by the cultural preservation efforts of the Afro-Ecuadorian socio-political project and movement known as etnoeducación. This initiative seeks to validate and strengthen afrochoteño identity in reclaiming local traditions and educating afrochoteño youth about Afro-Ecuadorian history and culture. Renewed interest in La Bomba is introducing stylistic changes, however, as afrochoteño youth incorporate foreign instruments, rhythms, and genres such as congas, salsa, and reggaeton. While some afrochoteños see such changes as a threat to the integrity of La Bomba and afrochoteño identity, others, in particular the youth who listen to and produce these newer Bomba fusions, see no such conflict and strongly identify with La Bomba as an expression of their distinct cultural identity. Though La Bomba's recent development raises questions concerning the impact of globalization on afrochoteño culture, it also provides a means of seeing how the afrochoteños' struggle as subalterns is implicated in the process of cultural change. Building on post-colonial and subaltern theories, I explore the ways in which La Bomba registers the afrochoteño experience of and response to racism, exploitation, and marginalization in Ecuador. In its revival and transformation, we can see how afrochoteños resource tradition and engage memory and global flows in their contestation of the epistemological hegemony that produces their subalternity. I argue that La Bomba's transformation is best approached in terms of agency rather than cultural loss or retention. Examined in this way, we can begin to understand change in this context not as an inevitable consequence of globalization, but as the means by which La Bomba and afrochoteño identity persist.",,,English,REVIEW

Founded in the late seventeenth century, the colleges reinvigorated the Franciscan missionary enterprise in the Americas as well as in Spain in the following two centuries. Under the Spanish Monarchy, the Franciscans established a network of twelve apostolic colleges on Iberian soil and seventeen in North and South America. Through their systematic missionary activities, the colleges worked as a parallel Franciscan trans-Atlantic organization which, along with the Jesuits, fuelled Spanish imperial expansion to remote areas on the fringes of the empire. The aim of the new institution was to train spiritually and intellectually missionaries who laboured among Catholics on both sides of the Atlantic and among non-believers beyond the frontiers of the Spanish empire. Thus, this study is an important contribution to the little known role that the Franciscans played in the Spanish Atlantic imperial networks in the age of enlightenment. Furthermore, by concentrating on Franciscan missionaries, this dissertation reveals the subtleties of religious and cultural expansion in both early modern Europe and colonial Spanish America. This study approaches the missionary instruction of the friars by centering on three pivotal aspects of the training program: the recruitment of the Franciscan friars, the daily life inside the colleges, and the missions that the friars preached to the Catholics in New Spain. First, the dissertation explores the institutional history of the colleges for the propagation of the faith, to focus on the internal organization of the College of Queretaro, the first one founded in 1683. It also analyzes the recruiting process through which the colleges examined and purged new members for the missionary enterprise. This work further describes the daily life inside the community, with an emphasis on the missionary training in the college classroom. Last, this work turns to the popular missions---the evangelical ministry of the missionaries to the faithful---the backdrop of the frontier missions.",,,English,REVIEW

Número formado pelo conjunto das cartas escritas a Inácio de Loyola e ao provincial jesuíta do Império português, Simão Rodrigues, somadas a um terceiro grupo: onze cartas edificantes enviadas aos companheiros jesuítas em geral. Temos como objetivo o estudo da trajetória de Xavier pelo Oriente, analisando suas passagens por quatro regiões: pelos mares do Índico; pelo o Sul da Índia; pelo Sudeste Asiático; e, por fim, pelas terras do Japão. Nosso interesse não está na análise de sua postura em cada região isoladamente, mas no estudo dialógico entre as posturas adotadas por onde passou. No Sul da Índia, Xavier batiza em massa; no Japão, lança mão das disputas dialéticas aos moldes das universidades europeias como pilar de seu método de evangelização. No Índico, apresenta-se como pregador mendicante; no Extremo Oriente, como embaixador intelectualizado. Além de sua ação, Xavier adapta também seu pensamento e a esse respeito nos atemos à aplicação das teorias coligadas ao direito natural, sobretudo, os conceitos de lei natural e razão natural, em função de uma reflexão sobre um sistema de comunicação natural entre as gentes. Em suma, nossa atenção está voltada, sobretudo, para a mudança na ação e pensamento do primeiro missionário jesuíta em função do projeto de conversão e das necessidades apresentadas nos encontros com os povos da Ásia.||The purpose of this paper is to study some letters written by the first Jesuit missionary, Francis Xavier. Focus was given to 39 out of a 139–page missive, which corresponds to the total set of letters written to Ignatius of Loyola and to the Jesuit Prior of the Portuguese Empire, Simão Rodrigues, added to a third group of eleven uplifting letters sent to his Jesuit companions in general. Its objective is to study Francis Xaviers course in the east, analysing his staying in four regions, namely: the Indian Ocean; the southern part of India; the southeast Asia; and, finally, the far east lands of Japan. And the concern lies not in the analysis of Francis posture in each region isolatedly, but in the dialogic study among the stances he adopted in the places where he passed by. In the south of India, Francis Xavier performs mass baptism; in Japan, he makes use of dialectical disputes similarly to those used by european universities as a cornerstone to his evangelization method. In the Indian Ocean he presents himself as a mendicant preecher whilst in the Far East, an intellectualized ambassador. Besides his action, Francis Xavier adapts also his thought and in this regard focus will be given to the implementation of theories connected with natural right; especially, the concepts of natural law and natural ratio, with the aim of reflecting on the natural communication system among peoples. Summarizing, the attention is drawn, mainly, to the change of action and thought of the first missionary in connection with the project of conversion and the entails arisen during the meetings with people in Asia.",,,Portuguese,REVIEW

The study combined literature of sportsmanship, moral development, social learning theory, self-motivation theory, and Jesuit education. The study used focus groups, conducted at Talin Prep, to gather qualitative data regarding coaches, sportsmanship, and Jesuit education. The results of the study found that coaches, teachers, and Jesuit priests at Talin Prep thought a sportsmanship training program for coaches in Jesuit schools was necessary and feasible. However, coaches held that sportsmanship training could only be achieved through mentoring. In contrast, teachers and Jesuit priests found that mentoring and a formal program were viable methods of sportsmanship training for coaches. Future researchers should consider (a) conducting a survey across all sports and all levels of Jesuit high school coaching experience to determine what coaches need to better teach and model sportsmanship to their studentathletes and what instructional methods are most effective in delivering a sportsmanship training curriculum throughout all JSEA member schools; (b) providing an opportunity for coaches to express any other development needs that they feel Jesuit schools should provide; and (c) asking for and investigating concrete examples of training methods and curriculum tools to be used in a nationwide program.",,,English,KEEP

Furthermore, would-be interpreters have lacked an adequate interpretive framework for the modern and religious identities that together characterize modern religious architecture. Thus, the problem is rooted both in history and theory: the solution requires 1) an interdisciplinary approach to the historical context of modernity that can properly situate such buildings in architectural and religious terms, and 2) a hermeneutic that is sufficiently rich to address the religious content, yet fluid and modest enough to be fruitful even from outside such theology-laden contexts. As identity is largely a matter of mainstream practice, the historical setting for this research is a significant but non-experimental context: post-WWII Rome. This period is marked by both a multifaceted identity crisis with distinctive political, architectural and theological aspects, and the Second Vatican Council (1962–65) that marked a shift in Catholicism's attitude towards modernity. The chief interpretive concept offering sufficient richness and fluidity to address modern religious architecture is mediation, relevant to both religious identity (especially on beauty and sacrament) and the identity of modern architecture (especially on ornament). The main interlocutors here are Hans Urs von Balthasar (1905–88), Karsten Harries (1937–), Oleg Grabar (1929–), and Jacques Maritain (1882–1973). The hermeneutic framework is forged and tested through formal and phenomenological analyses of four post-WWII Catholic churches in Rome that are exemplary of four modes of mediation: 1) San Giovanni Bosco (1952–59), by Gaetano Rapisardi: critique; 2) San Gregorio VII (1959–61), by Paniconi and Pediconi: updating; 3) San Policarpo (1960–67), by Giuseppe Nicolosi: retrieval; 4) Sancta Maria Mater Ecclesiae (1965–70), Luigi Moretti's unbuilt ""Chiesa del Concilio"": invention. These analyses also reveal four distinct forms of ornament -- material, tectonic, geometric, and spatial -- that are discernible largely through a reconsideration of ornament as defined primarily through its mediating function. The conclusion evaluates the fecundity of the hermeneutic and suggests possibilities for further research.",,,English,REVIEW

As an authentic source of saving knowledge of God such that its reception brings union with God and others, the sensus fidelium ought to be a source for episcopal teaching. In his reception of the sensus fidelium, the bishop continues to learn and to be transformed by the apostolic faith, and is in turn better able to teach the faith with authority. If the bishop's reception of the sensus fidelium is integral to his ability to teach the apostolic faith in an authoritative manner, then the orthopraxis of that reception is of great importance. One aspect of that orthopraxis is the bishop's discernment of the sensus fidelium. As a ministerial habitus, discernment has implications both for the bishop's personal transformation and for his ability to place his spirituality at the service of the apostolate. The Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola and the structures of the Society of Jesus are employed as a comparative model of discernment. The Spiritual Exercises offers a way of viewing discernment as a virtue that develops one's capacity for both reception from and union with God and others. Discernment in the Society of Jesus is undertaken to foster unity of understanding and purpose at the service of the Society's apostolate. Structures promoting discernment and relating spirituality to authority provide insights into how discernment may be developed within the larger church.",,,English,KEEP

Starting with the China Illustrata of Athanasius Kircher, the first chapter proceeds to archaeo-historically excavate Kircher's language-theoretical sources and influences ultimately reaching all the way back to the intellectual-historical origins of ideography in the texts of Aristotle and Plato. The second chapter examines traditional Chinese discussions of language (including the origin and function of writing), focusing on two ancient dictionaries: the Erya and the Shuowen jiezi . This chapter explains just how different pre-modern Chinese language theory is from Western ideographic speculation including the stark contrast between the Erya and such works as Peter Mark Roget's eponymous Thesaurus of English Words and Phrases . The vast difference between the two, simply stated, is that traditional Chinese theory requires quotidian human intent and concrete socio-historical embeddedness for linguistic meaning to function, whereas traditional Western theory requires reified, universal, transhistorical, perhaps even extraterrestrial Forms ( eide, ideai )--what Derrida and others have called the ""transcendental signifieds."" The third chapter carries these language-theoretical issues to an examination of the work of the scribe Sima Qian (145–87 B.C.E.), who laid the cornerstone of author-theory in China. Forcibly castrated by the emperor for a crime he did not commit, consumed by humiliation and rage, Sima Qian proceeded to compile the monumental 130 chapter Records of the Scribe , one of the most sophisticated and politically provocative documents in the history Chinese letters a text that ended up serving as the model for all subsequent historiography as well as biographical and autobiographical writing, prose fiction, and even much literary theory and criticism. The larger implication of the dissertation is that a better understanding of the differences in how the Chinese and Western traditions have discussed language, particularly how linguistic meaning functions, may well help to lead contemporary (posthumanist) theory to a more nuanced and culturally inclusive view of authorial intention.",,,English,REVIEW

Approximately one hundred years after the Jesuit's introduction of Christianity to Japan in 1549, the Japanese government issued numerous bans on Christianity followed by a series of persecutions and deportations. Some devotees resisted the government decrees and chose to disguise themselves as non-Christians to survive. Known today as Hidden Christians, these people continued to practice their faith while altering their religious expressions. Often thought of as a symbol of defeat and compliance to the government, the paintings of Hidden Christians of the Ikitsuki Island diverged from the conventional Christian images created by the missionary studios established in Japan and incorporated some of the local visual elements and symbolisms. This thesis applies the postcolonial theory of mimicry to shed light on the elements of resistance and subversion found in the Hidden Christian icons. In addition, it examines the Jesuits' missionary approaches and the use of their Spiritual Exercises in Japan to demonstrate the Ikitsuki Hidden Christians' ability to appropriate their faith through their unique visual expression within the context of their reality.",,,English,REVIEW

Subtle activism is defined as ""practices of spirit or consciousness intended to support collective transformation"" and is thus contrasted with spiritual practices that focus on individual transformation. An example is a globally-synchronized meditation and prayer event intended to support world peace. I argue that subtle activism is an emerging panentheistic religious or spiritual impulse that occurs most coherently in the context of an integral, participatory, and re-enchanted worldview. As a context for understanding the potential evolutionary significance of subtle activism, I present the evolution of consciousness frameworks of Teilhard de Chardin, Thomas Berry, and Richard Tarnas. Teilhard, Berry, and Tarnas share the view that our era can be understood as a critical turning point in the evolution of consciousness and that what is most called for, if we are to successfully meet the evolutionary challenge, is a radical shift in consciousness--a fundamentally new understanding of who we are and how we relate to each other, the planet, and the universe. I argue that these frameworks help to illuminate the potentially crucial role subtle activism may have to play in the collective transition we are called to make.",,,English,REVIEW

F., 1904–1984","This dissertation offers a critical response to the fundamental sacramental theology of Louis-Marie Chauvet drawing on the works of Bernard Lonergan. Chauvet has articulated a significant critique of the western theological tradition's use of metaphysics, especially in interpreting doctrines relating to the presence of Christ in the Eucharist, liturgical sacrifice, and sacramental causality. Chauvet's criticisms raise questions about what philosophical tools allow theologians to develop a fruitful analogical understanding of the mysteries communicated in the sacraments. This dissertation responds to Chauvet's challenge to theology to adopt a new foundation in the symbolic by turning to the derived, critical metaphysics of Bernard Lonergan. The dissertation argues that Lonergan's critical metaphysics can help theologians to develop fruitful understandings of doctrines relating to Eucharistic presence, liturgical sacrifice, and sacramental causality. In addition Lonergan's categories of meaning offer resources for interpreting sacramental doctrines on the level of the time, while maintaining the genuine achievements of the past.|Chapter one presents a survey of some recent Catholic Eucharistic theologies in order to provide a context for our investigation. Here we identify existentialist-phenomenological, postmodern, and neo-traditionalist approaches to Eucharistic doctrines. Chapters two, three, and four present a dialectical comparison of Chauvet and Lonergan on metaphysics as it pertains to Eucharistic theology specifically. Chapter two examines Chauvet's postmodern critique of metaphysical foundations of scholastic Eucharistic theology. Our particular concern will be with Chauvet's methods, especially whether his appropriation of the Heideggerian critique of scholastic theology offers an accurate account of Thomas Aquinas, and whether it offers a fruitful way forward in Eucharistic theology. Chapter three explores Lonergan's foundations for metaphysics in cognitional theory and epistemology. Lonergan's critical groundwork in cognitional theory attends to the problems of bias and the polymorphism of human consciousness that lead to a heuristic metaphysics rather than a tidy conceptual system. Chapter four explicates Lonergan's heuristic metaphysics and articulates the elements of metaphysics that enable an understanding of the general category of causality in critical realist metaphysics. Chapter five explores Lonergan's foundations for theological reflection paying particular attention to the importance of intellectual conversion before going on to survey Lonergan's categories of meaning. Chapter six engages the task of systematic theology and proposes an understanding of Eucharistic doctrines grounded in Lonergan's critical realist philosophy and transposed into categories of meaning.",,,English,REVIEW

The thesis explores the roots of the novellas in certain currents in philosophy, theology and literature. Casuistry, which had permeated the Novelas ejemplares; the very premise of the twelve examples or ""ejemplos"" is rooted in casuistry. The thesis focuses on the recurring moralistic theme which flows through and ties together the novellas: the shaping of the male and female identity, the development of disinterested love and the sacrament of marriage. This message also has it's roots in seventeenth century though, during which period the Council of Trent revised regulations in regards to formal marriages. Cervantes did not hesitate to employ the use of different genres, including the novella from Italy, the Picaresque novel, the Byzantine novel and others; however, the study reveals that Cervantes adapted these genres to his own ends and never fell into the trap of imitation or the box of categorization. Cervantes plays with these genres in order to give the reader a multidimensional view of reality, in which reality is never linear or simple, but always complex and deceiving. It is this deception and complexity which often fuels the suspense in the novellas. Underlying the novellas is an Ignatian or Jesuit artistic slant in which Cervantes illuminates what is good and beautiful and also what is dark and obscure, but in such a vivid way that the reader is mysteriously brought into the presence of the image in a multidimensional manner. It is the Ignatian illumination which permits the novellas to communicate to readers aesthetically and artistically that which is to be admired and imitated and that which is to be despised by the reader, without descending into preachy, ponderous narration as other novels of the epoch were prone to do. This thesis will reveal what is most striking about the novellas: the integration of the content and the form and style in such a way that they draw upon each other and become inseparable.",,,English,REVIEW

It analyses the impact of wider ideological and social imperatives on the diarists’ subjective experience and reads their tendency to silence the self as a symptom of the cultural pressure to merge their private and public persona. These diaries represented a forum in which the diarists perpetually negotiated their own value within the Victorian ideology of productivity and thus not only reflect their inner world but also the cultural climate of the nineteenth century. Chapter One traces the selected diarists’ reluctance to reveal private information, as well as their tendency to foreground professional productivity, to the social pressure to efface emotions relating to the self and to only cultivate those that nurtured the community. It identifies the similarities between the compulsive self-discipline advocated in the psychological discourse of the period, particularly Alexander Bain’s The Emotions and the Will (1859), and the willingness to both live up to and actively shape the cultural codes of respectability that Elizabeth Eastlake and Henry Crabb Robinson display in their diaries. Chapter Two compares and contrasts the desire for maximal professional productivity as exhibited in George Eliot’s and George Gissing’s diaries. Both worked obstinately in order to increase their own value: whereas Eliot sought to redeem her ‘guilt of the privileged,’ Gissing desperately needed to increase his financial solvency through literary output. Chapter Three discusses the ways in which John Ruskin’s diary helped him block out unrespectable and painful private experiences through transforming his obsessive desire to appropriate and “feel” visual experience into a professional task. Chapter Four shows that Gerard Manley Hopkins—because he was acutely concerned by his cultural otherness caused by his homosexuality—not only sought refuge and validation by joining the Jesuits, but by narrowing his realm of experience to nature, merged the private and the public self into the figure of the professional, asexual, dutiful and disinterested observer.",,,English,REVIEW

F., 1904–1984","This dissertation considers the mystery of the relationship between human free choice and God by focusing on the Controversy de Auxiliis (1582–1607) and the thought of Domingo Báñez, O.P. (1528–1604) in particular. The dissertation comprises four chapters and a conclusion preceded by a preface and brief historical introduction. The preface introduces the issue to be explored and the motivations for exploring it before providing a general synopsis of the dissertation that is more detailed than the present abstract. The historical summary that follows introduces a theological debate that has become widely unfamiliar to contemporary theology, even while conceptually, that debate remains perennial. The four-chapter body that follows may be divided into two general parts: Broadly, chapters One and Two exposit Báñez’s thought, while chapters Three and Four critique it. Chapter One explores Báñez’s positive account of physical premotion, human freedom and sin. Chapter Two examines Báñez’s critique of Luis de Molina S.J.’s alternative proposal, in conjunction with some contemporary sources from both sides of the debate (Molina was Báñez’s principal adversary in the Controversy de Auxiliis). Báñez’s line of critique in Chapter Two is found to be cogent. Chapter Three investigates Molina’s critique of Báñez and finds it too to be cogent, even though Molina’s positive account was found to be problematic in Chapter Two. Chapter Four begins by exploring Bernard Lonergan S.J.’s work on divine causality and human free choice. Lonergan attempts to provide a fresh historical reading of Aquinas that is unencumbered by the presuppositions of the Controversy de Auxiliis. The first part of Chapter Four explains Lonergan’s critique of Báñez and finds it convincing, while the second part of the chapter finds Lonergan’s interpretation of Aquinas problematic from a theoretical standpoint. Chapter Four then offers a constructive critique of Lonergan’s interpretation before advancing an alternative way to think about God’s causation of human free choices. In closing, this dissertation argues that God creates human free choices, but that in creating a human free choice, God, or God’s creative will, is not an antecedent condition that determines choice. Rather, God creates the entire reality of a human free choice—both what it is and that it is—and in so doing, part of the reality God creates just is that choice’s being up to its human agent.",Electronic copy restricted until 4th June 2015.,,English,REVIEW

In response to his early Jesuit education, he developed a secular alternative to theology with his existential phenomenology. Theology, poetry, and phenomenology share the basic concern of explaining the foundations of being. For Heidegger, ownership characterizes being in a fundamental way; in Contributions to Philosophy (From Enowning), he establishes the ""Ereignis"" (""event of appropriation"") as the foundation of being. Ownership lies at the core of being in his thinking following Being and Time. Yet his philosophy ignores the material circumstances of ownership. By way of a materialist critique of Heidegger's Idealist phenomenology, I expose how property-relations are encoded in the modern poetry and philosophy of dwelling with the question: who owns the house of being? The answer lies in ""self-possession,"" which represents historical subjectivity as the struggle for the means of production. Paul Celan, T. S. Eliot, Rainer Maria Rilke, and Paul Valery are all poets who address the relationship between being and ownership in expressing what Marx and Engels call the ""language of real life"" in The German Ideology (26). In 1927, Eliot converted to Anglicanism and found solace in the realm of faith; by opting for the theology of dispossession, he surrendered his historical subjectivity. Rilke thought that he could find refuge from the marketplace in aesthetic beauty and pure philosophy but eventually disabused himself of his illusion. Similarly, Valery sought refuge in the space of thought; basing reality in the mind, he forsook the social realm as the site of contestation for gaining ownership over being. As a poet who distinguished himself from the Idealism of his predecessors, Celan developed a structure of dialogue based upon shared exchange on common ground. A materialist approach to the poetry and philosophy of dwelling exposes property-relations as the foundation of the house of being.",,,English,REVIEW

They do not consider Chinese philosophy as a philosophy but regard its contributions as wisdoms, thoughts or spiritualities. My study attempts to understand this fact by identifying the emergence of such representation across several centuries and starts with its reception in France through Jesuit missionaries in the sixteenth century. This thesis argues that French philosophers' representation of Chinese philosophy is an Orientalist legacy that French philosophers and scholars have built from a distorted, biased and reductionist view of China and its philosophy as formulated by the Jesuits. This problem of the existence of Chinese philosophy can only be understood if it is approached in relation to the eurocentric and Orientalist ideology that characterizes philosophy and addressed through the intellectual coloniality that dominates traditional epistemology by deconstructing it.",,,French,REVIEW

This study focused on two questions, (a) How do leaders perceive the future of Jesuit higher education? and (b) What key factors identified by these leaders will lead to the most desirable outcome for Jesuit higher education in the next twenty years? Interviews were conducted with ten leaders from the Jesuit higher education community. The ten participants included presidents, provosts, high-ranking officials, and directors. Eight participants are employed in universities across the United States, and two participants are employed as administrators of Jesuit education. The methodology used in this study was Ethnographic Futures Research, an approach used to elicit participant perceptions of alternative futures from optimistic, pessimistic, and most probable future scenarios. This study aimed to present a strategic outline in the form of recommendations to guide leaders of Jesuit institutions through times of rapid and imminent change. Findings from this study include identification of common perceptions of factors that will influence change to the future of Jesuit higher education. Factors of change include leadership strategies, economic impact, technological advances, and evolving student demographics. Findings further revealed more specific driving forces of change, including faculty influence, societal influence, and Jesuit identity issues. A general discovery made by this study was the significant acceptance that change cannot be avoided and strategies must be implemented so as not to respond and react to these changes, but to engage in change with the confidence only attained through strategic and ongoing future studies that will aid in the sustainability of Jesuit higher education institutions in the United States.",,,English,KEEP

While this success is well documented, significant challenges currently threaten Catholic schools: demographic shifts, the changing role of religion in the lives of American Catholics, increasing education options for parents, and a paucity of priests. Many Catholic schools have been forced to restructure or regionalize. Many single-parish schools have been closed because they cannot financially continue.|It is the purpose of this research to investigate and then promote a more collaborative, codeterminative model of governance for Catholic schools by relating a historical account of America's Church governance and the precedent set by John England, first Bishop of Charleston, circa 1820. Bishop England laid the foundation for greater democracy and broader equity with the laity within the native Church in the governance of the American Catholic Church's temporal matters.|The spirit of independence helped form the early American Catholic Church under the leadership of Bishop John Carroll. He had envisioned a church that would recognize the pope as the spiritual head of the universal Church; but the American Catholic Church would conduct its temporal affairs in deference to the federal government in the new nation.|While Carroll established Georgetown University, St. Mary's Seminary in Baltimore, and supported the use of the vernacular in liturgy, his true vision of American governance in the Church would not be achieved until Bishop John England wrote a constitution delineating the responsibilities of the clergy and the laity and forming a bicameral governance structure for the diocese of Charleston. His clearly defined constitution alleviated problems between the clergy and laity that had arisen under trusteeism.|With the changing structures of today's Catholic schools, priests and laity are called to greater collaboration. School boards must have clearly defined authority and responsibilities, especially accountability. Selected board members must have the talent and ability to lead schools that require greater stewardship and collaboration.",,,English,REVIEW

Before Dominica became a formal British colony in 1763, Caribs, French settlers, free and enslaved Africans, and people of mixed ancestry inhabited this island frontier. The frontier is defined as a transformative, dynamic contact zone where there were daily interactions among people of varied backgrounds. Moreover, settlement of Dominica is limited to a band of coastal enclaves because of the island's mountainous topography and thick vegetation. The landscape is approached as the materiality of an ongoing interaction between Jesuit ideology and the specific and historically situated variables or ""boundary processes"" in this enclave, which then shaped social and economic relations in the frontier. Excavations reveal the spatial layout of the church, factory, and residence and sampled subsurface layers dating to the Jesuit period. The spatial data reveal that the mission site prioritized visibility of the cross and church and created a network of free and enslaved settlers in the Grand Bay enclave. Exchange networks are shown by fragments of hand-made pots, industrially produced wares, and imported European manufactured goods. By focusing on the frontier context this study improves understandings of space within Caribbean frontiers and explores interconnections with colonies and the metropole. This study departs from historical accounts which situate Grand Bay in the context of how this site contributed to the dissolution of the French Society of Jesus, and broadens the approach to missions, as Grand Bay functioned as a multicrop plantation using enslaved African labor and a parish church in a neutral island.",,,English,KEEP

The project of such art production was initiated by Italian Jesuit Alessandro Valignano, and supervised by Italian painter Giovanni Niccolò during the Jesuit presence in Japan, which began in the latter half of sixteenth century and lasted until 1614. The center of production of this type of art was the workshop adjunct to the Jesuit seminary, where Niccolò trained about a dozen students with European painting techniques, such as chiaroscuro, foreshortening, modeling and linear perspective. The discussion is centered on Christian paintings and a selection of printed images produced in Japan by Niccolò’s students. By examining the formal characteristics of these works in comparison with their European sources, this dissertation views Jesuit art in Japan as part of a sequence of artistic products and practices brought to Japan by Jesuit missionaries and European traders. At the same time, the discussion argues that these works deserve to be regarded independently because of their unique origin, system of production, and history. Chapter One provides an overview of scholarship on the field and makes the specific intervention of this dissertation clear. The discussion focuses on the problem of so-called Nanban art, the term with which Jesuit artworks in Japan have been labeled. Chapter Two discusses the founding and operation of the Jesuit seminary and art workshop. A Madonna and Child and a Salvator Mundi along with twelve paintings framed utilizing techniques from traditional Japanese craftsmanship are discussed to illustrate stylistic features characteristic of Japanese students at the seminary. Chapter Three provides a historical outline for the arrival of European visual images, which functioned as sources for the Jesuit art production in Japan. Chapter Four looks closely at two paintings of Our Lady and the Fifteen Mysteries as case studies. Drawing on primary sources, including Jesuit letters and reports, as well as the relationship between the art production in question and European sources, this dissertation challenges conventional views of the Christian art produced in Japan during the period in question in order to provide a new, art-historically based perspective, on the first encounter between Europe and Japan.",,,English,KEEP

We notice in the correspondence and documents of the XVI century that catechizing and educating the natives of Portuguese America happened from the Jesuitical pedagogy which was privileging entertainment strategies such as theater, corals, singing, dancing and the music amongst other actions promoting this way the interaction and the symbiosis between the native culture and the European culture.

These two concerns, while distinct, are intimately related and find their practical outworking in the important practice of interreligious dialogue.|Utilizing resources from Martin Luther's theology and the Lutheran confessional writings, this study offers an understanding of the Christian gospel as promise as key to addressing the above mentioned missiological challenges. In its construction of a confessional Lutheran missiology, it critically retrieves and constructively reappropriates four resources from the Lutheran tradition: the gospel as promise, the law/gospel distinction, a theology of grace as promise of mercy fulfilled, and a theology of the cross utilizing the hiddenness of God. The law of God as accusing, yet webbing humanity to its Creator; the gospel as the comforting promise of vulnerable, loving mercy; and the hiddenness of God as elusively mystifying form the overarching framework within which a contemporary Lutheran missiology seeks to engage the religious other by dialectically relating gospel proclamation and dialogue. Such a Lutheran view of ""mission shaped by promise"" constitutes an alternative voice within the contemporary missiological landscape, dominated by an understanding of grace as human nature fulfilled and an approach to the missiological task as identifying traces of divine grace and truth in the midst of interreligious work toward human peace and justice. While humbly receiving the deepest witness of its dialogue partner, such a Lutheran approach boldly offers the paradoxical revelation and hiddenness of God in the cross as a distinctively Christian contribution to an interreligious dialogue centered on the ambiguity and hiddenness of God in daily experience.",,,English,REVIEW

The task is largely to present from his opus magnum (a triptych encompassing Herrlichkeit, Theodrama and Theologik ) the positions that must be understood if one is to understand the project as a whole, and to present them in the form of deductions from first principles.|Therefore, taking von Balthasar's starting point in the person of Jesus Christ as the metaphysical first principle, the first question is to ask what the relationship between that reality and the created world is. This question is answered in general terms as being one of participation. This general answer is then set in contrast to theologies of identity, in which God and the world are ultimately reducible to one another, a contrast which highlights that the relationship between Christ and the world that von Balthasar wants is one of analogy.|The specific notion of analogy von Balthasar is working with is one that requires a robust place for historicity--accordingly, some time is spent establishing the historical dimensions of the Incarnate Christ. This enables the understanding of analogy as likeness within greater unlikeness to emerge, an understanding which roots the unlikeness in the aseity of God. This in turn grounds a likeness whose strength will be seen in the way that creatures in their being image the Trinity. The theological upshot is a view of the divine activity in which every action of God from Trinitarian procession to final redemption is seen as self-giving, which is understood as the fundamental character of divine love.",,,English,REVIEW

The disciplines of history and anthropology necessarily inform my work; the former gives it depth and the latter nuance. My research includes reports from council meetings, court hearings, congressional testimony, tribal newsletters, newspaper accounts, fieldnotes, and interviews. From these materials, as well as from my life experiences, I construct a narrative history of the interaction of Euro-Americans and Native Americans who live together in the region of the Western Door of the Haudenosaunee, or Iroquois Confederacy.|The actions of Jesuit priests, the earliest whites who lived among Senecas, foreshadow the actions of those who came later. Thus, many twenty-first century New Yorkers desire that Senecas give up both their culture and their land. To illustrate this I explore in detail major confrontations and analyze the way they have negatively impacted on Seneca culture and the Allegany Seneca land base.|I have chosen the city of Salamanca as my geographical focus in order to reveal the nature of the ongoing interactions between Senecas and Euro-Americans. Salamanca is an anomaly in that it is the only city in the United States that lies almost entirely within the borders of an Indian reservation. The history of how that occurred and why it has continued to affect Senecas and their neighbors is central to my research. I am fortunate that I was raised on the Allegany Territory in Salamanca so that I could receive neighborly help from my many Seneca and Euro-American neighbors, friends, acquaintances, and officials.|Seneca culture, like any culture, changes. Yet, in spite of many military, cultural, and political assaults, Senecas maintain their particularity, their unique ""Seneca-ness"", and their authenticity. This is not always readily apparent to non-Senecas. In this dissertation I will demonstrate that the tropes of decline and assimilation are fallacious and that Seneca culture remains both traditional and vibrant. Familial relations remain surprisingly unchanged, in spite of what many believe. Women have an unbroken record of agency in spite of paternalistic impositions. By agency I mean the ability to control their lives and influence Seneca economic, political, social and other spheres. Many of the values and characteristics of Seneca particularity, such as an unyielding sense of place, have always infused Seneca worldviews. This is not to say that tragedies--such as land and language loss--have not occurred.|Senecas, in spite of the actions of their neighbors, have continued their cultural particularity with humor, dignity and magnanimity. Their culture has changed, sometimes with tragic losses, sometimes with admirable adaptations. Through it all, they remain Seneca. And nowadays, more often than not, the Senecas' neighbors are friends.",,,English,REVIEW

Prior to the 1630s, members of the community struggled with persecution or, if fortunate, benign neglect. The 1630s, however, marked a noticeable shift in how this community was treated by the Stuart court. A group of English Catholics responded to the changing atmosphere, hoping for toleration and even reunion. These individuals, including Franciscus ‡ Sancta Clara, Thomas White, Henry Holden, Serenus Cressy, and John Austin, attempted to re-create an English Catholic identity. English Catholics had long been stigmatized because of the radicalism of the Jesuits, particularly in the Protestant imagination. Jesuits were considered to be ultramontanists, uncompromising doctrinaires, and fifth columnists who were constantly working to undermine the state. In constructing an identity that was rooted in the rhetoric of moderation, moderate Catholics contended that these Protestant concerns were stylized and misperceived. They attempted to resolve the inconsistencies associated with their two seemingly incompatible identities, English and Catholic, suggesting that this conciliation now warranted toleration. They thus attempted to ""un-Jesuit"" the Catholic image by establishing a religious and political common ground with the Protestant majority. To do so, they proclaimed allegiance at first to the monarchy and later to the commonwealth, appeared willing to modify Catholic teachings, and attempted to weaken their ties with the papacy, always prioritizing the common good; they essentially portrayed themselves firstly as good English subjects and secondly as Catholics. Often opportunistic and occasionally adopting dubious theological stances, they capitalized on shifting political moments to secure their lives and properties, to live free of religious persecution, and to acquire power and liberty over their consciences.",,,English,REVIEW

The thesis is a narrative, with comentary on the political events of the reign of James VI, including the relationship Huntly had with James VI and the wider repercussions thereof. Huntly returned to Scotland from France in July 1581, becoming a courtier and an adherent of Esme Stewart, duke of Lennox. He served a political apprenticeship to Lennox and was exposed to covert Catholic politicking, as well as to the nascent Jesuit mission in Scotland. After James was captured by the Ruthven Raiders in August 1582, Huntly entered politics in his own right, becoming influential in the opposition to the rithven regime. Huntly assisted in enforcing the regime change when James escaped from the Ruthven lords in June 1583, his loyalty to the king winning James's trust and close friendship - the dividends of which he reaped throughout his life. Huntly initially supported the new administration under James Stewart, earl of Arran and assiduously attended to his duties in both the locality and the central government. Following Arran's fall in November 1585, Huntly deliberately distanced himself from the Court and the new Anglophile government. He opposed the anglo-Scottish treaty which was concluded in July 1586 and worked hard to counter the rise of John Maitland of Thirlestane. For the first time, Huntly made contact with the European counter-Reformation in Apriland May 1586. The period June 1587 to April 1589 was marked by faction fighting between Huntly and Maitland, who were both instrumental in James' pursuit of diametrically opposed policies. The discovery of Huntly's covert correspondece with Spain in February 1589 made his Catholic politicking public, subsequently colouring the conflict vetween Maitland and Huntly with confessional politics. Events excalated until Huntly mustered troops on the field of Brig o' Dee near Aberdeen, Although Huntly refused to meet the king on the field, Maitland's vitory was only parial. Brig o' Dee was not the manifestation of the politics of the Counter-Reformation in Scotland, but the productof years of faction fighting between Maitland and Huntly. The period of January 1590 to March 1595 was characterised by Hunrly's continuing influence at Court with marked favour from James and his bloodfeud with James Stewart, second earl of Moray. Huntly used his twin centres of influnce, the Court and power in the region, to fight a vivious and protacted bloodfeud with Moray and his faction. The interception of the Spanish Blanks at the end of 1592 brought confessional politics to bear on a purely secular bloodfeud. Political agitation from the Kirk and Stewarts caused James to commission an army under Archibald Campbell, seventh earl of Argyll to pursue Huntly in October 1594. The result was the battle of Glenlivet between Huntly and Argyll which came to represent the fight against Catholicism, although its root cause was Huntly's bloodfeud with Moray and the Stewarts. When James later raised his own army and marched north against Huntly, the early refused to face James on the field and in March 1595 he voluntarily went into exile abroad. This ended the most active phase of huntly's participation in national and international politics; after his political rehabilitation in 1597, he no longer played an influential role in the king's domestic or foreign policies. Overall, the thesis agues that Huntly needs to be understood as a political faction leader, whose Catholicism was a tool he eomplyed to widen his political influence but not the determinant of all his actions.",,,English,REVIEW
Dissertation,"Goad, Keith Wesley",2010,Trinitarian Grammars: A Comparison of Gregory of Nazianzus and Some Contemporary Models,"Louisville, KY",Southern Baptist Theological Seminary,"xi, 329",PhD diss.,,,http://hdl.handle.net/10392/2653,,20th century,Theology -- Trinity,Europe,"Rahner, Karl, 1904–1984","There is a growing trend among contemporary models to claim that their model is based upon the Eastern tradition in opposition to the Western model represented by Augustine. The purpose of the dissertation is to describe the doctrines of the knowledge of God and the Trinity as articulated by Gregory of Nazianzus, the Eastern father who defined these doctrines for the Eastern tradition, for the purpose of critically evaluating the contemporary models that seek to find their historical precedent in the Cappadocians.|The first two chapters demonstrate Gregory's doctrines of the knowledge of God and the Trinity in order to demonstrate how his numerous confessions all relate to and modify one another. Gregory's doctrine of God was based upon God's nature being infinite and only known through his actions and names. Gregory's doctrine of the Trinity is multifaceted so that he uses a number of grammars to defend the unity and the three persons. Chapter four compares Augustine's On The Trinity to Gregory's grammars to provide a concrete comparison between the two traditions to demonstrate that the typical paradigm that contrasts the East and West is oversimplified and wrong.|The contemporary models will then be analyzed in light of Gregory's grammars and model in order to demonstrate that they have introduced concepts and grammars that are contrary to that of Gregory. The contemporary theologians analyzed include Karl Rahner, Cornelius Plantinga, Bruce Ware, and Thom McCall. The contemporary models are wrong to claim Gregory as their historical precedent because they fail to meet the most basic standards of Orthodoxy as presented by Gregory. One of the main problems in the contemporary treatment of Gregory is that his doctrine is oversimplified so that one aspect or grammar is emphasized and the others are ignored. There is confusion over the proper relationship between the economic and immanent Trinities. There is also a number of problems in how the terms one, unity, essence, and person have been redefined by the contemporary models when compared to Gregory's doctrine. The final argument is that the contemporary models fail to provide the necessary grammars and confessions that safeguard the doctrine of the Trinity and promote worship when compared to Gregory.",,,English,REVIEW
