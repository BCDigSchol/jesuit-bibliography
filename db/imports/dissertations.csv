Dissertation,"Abril, Michael Anthony",2015,The Beginning of the End: Original Sin and Apocalypse in View of Karl Rahner and René Girard,,University of Notre Dame,,PhD diss.,,,http://etd.nd.edu/ETD-db/theses/available/etd-04112015-115002/,,,Theology -- Dogmatic|Theology -- Sin|Theology -- Anthropology,,"Rahner, Karl, 1904–1984","In this contemporary retrieval of the Christian doctrine of original sin oriented toward an apocalyptic perspective, we pursue a deeper understanding of this doctrine that is built upon a rigorous and critical retrieval of the ideas of Karl Rahner and René Girard. Their diverse insights reveal the historicity of sin in a remarkable way. They show not only that the universality of original sin is grounded upon the fact that sin happened at the beginning of human history, but also that the concrete historical effects of our decisions continue to have a deleterious influence upon the exercise of human freedom, such that all of our decisions are codetermined by a prior history of guilt and distorted desire. Sin truly has a history, and our concrete actions are the means by which this history makes progress toward our death and self-annihilation. At the same time, from within human history the truth of the Gospel struggles against the escalation of sin and works to bring human history out of the meaninglessness of evil and toward realizing and revealing the deeper meaning of the world in view of the eschatological future.|Rather than reducing the truth of original sin to a simple formula, we proceed by showing the complex and profound interrelation of several different theological aspects. Guided by Rahner and Girard and in conversation with contemporary viewpoints, we explore issues of human evolution, history, freedom, desire, and the ways in which society and culture incline us toward sin. We then constructively expand upon these ideas. Linking Rahner’s theology with Girard’s apocalyptic perspective, we illustrate the ways in which sin continues to make progress in our world: by infiltrating and distorting our naturally-good desires, aesthetic systems, societal institutions, and even our very biological nature.|These reflections are ultimately directed toward combining a deeper appreciation of divine grace with a revitalized Christian ethic of striving toward justice even in the face of escalating violence. By our actions for a better world, we hope for the transcendent and apocalyptic victory of divine love over original sin.","|Academic Department:  Theology|Advisor:  O'Regan, Cyril",,English,KEEP|REVIEW
Dissertation,"Ackerman, Robert Steven",2007,Genetic Engineering: A Fundamental Moral Approach,New York,Fordham University,269,PhD diss.,,,http://fordham.bepress.com/dissertations/AAI3255036,,20th century|21st century,Theology -- Moral|Sciences -- Genetics -- Controversies,,"Rahner, Karl, 1904–1984","This dissertation contends that the fundamental moral themes of the relationship between nature and person and the relationship between faith and reason can be used to retrieve a natural law approach that adequately addresses the weaknesses of two models of creation, the stewardship position and the created co-creator position, that have been used to assess the limits and possibilities of genetic engineering in human beings. This revised natural law approach, in turn, specifies a third model of creation that I have termed ""limited co-creator."" As a corrective to these earlier models, the limited co-creator model steers a course between the extremes of a stewardship position that severely restricts genetic manipulation and a created co-creator position that some advocates have used to justify unlimited genetic manipulation.|Relying on the insights of such theologians as Karl Rahner, Wilhem Korff, and Franz Böckle, this investigation argues that a retrieved natural law position is grounded by a properly construed relationship between nature and person where nature is foundational to person and person functions as the sufficient criterion for the universality of moral judgment. It also argues that this properly construed relationship between nature and person presupposes a theological horizon that inspires reason and is further specified by it. Klaus Demmer's anthropological implications of faith are used in this study to guide moral reason in its assessment of the four types of genetic engineering potentially available to human beings, including somatic cell therapy, germ-line gene therapy, enhancement somatic engineering, and germ-line enhancement, prior to going down the clinical path. The limited co-creator model that is specified by this approach avoids a naturalism that makes nature normative, a naïve rationalism that rejects the insights of faith, and an isolating fideism that marginalizes reason by making the insights of faith impervious to analysis.","|Academic Department:  Theology|Advisor:  Kopfensteiner, Thomas R.",,English,CULL|REVIEW

Formé auprès de Charles Le Brun à la Manufacture royale des Gobelins, il y rencontre Jean-Baptiste Colbert qui devient son premier mécène. Protégé par ce dernier qui l’envoie en Italie, Théodon rejoint en 1677 l’Académie de France à Rome où il sculpte pour Louis XIV et le château de Versailles. Parallèlement il prend part à la vie académique romaine. Membre actif de l’Accademia di San Luca et de la congrégation des Virtuosi al Pantheon, Théodon devient l’un des sculpteurs les plus recherchés de la Rome de la fin du Seicento, sollicité par les papes Innocent XII et Clément XI à Saint-Pierre de Rome et au Latran, et par les congrégations et les ordres religieux au Gesù et au Monte di Pietà. Appelé par Louis XIV, il revient à Paris en 1705 et contribue, durant ses dernières années, à la décoration des Maison royales de Marly et de Meudon. Abordant avec brio l’allégorie et la sculpture animalière pour Colbert, la mythologie et le genre historique pour Louis XIV, la sculpture funéraire et l’art du portrait pour Christine de Suède, le sculpteur s’illustre avant tout dans l’art religieux. Brillante personnalité artistique du XVIIe siècle, Théodon méritait une étude. Nous avons considéré sa vie et sa carrière, analysé sa manière et établi le corpus exhaustif de son œuvre.| |Jean-Baptiste Théodon (1645–1713) was a French sculptor of the reign of Louis XIV who belonged both to the French and Italian schools of sculpture of the Seventeenth-Century. In the 1670’s during his training at the ‘Manufacture des Gobelins’ he worked under the supervision of Charles Le Brun and met the minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert. In 1677 he joined the French Academy in Rome where he carved garden sculptures for royal estates and for his protector Colbert. Early in his Roman carrier he was made member of the Academy of St Luke and member of the Congregazione dei Virtuosi al Pantheon where he met Bernini, the architect Carlo Fontana and the painter Carlo Maratta. Appreciated by the Pope Innocent XII he obtained several commissions at Saint-Peter’s (Baptismal chapel, Monument to Christine of Sweden) and at the same time he worked for the Jesuits at the Sant’Ignazio chapel at the Gesù. As one of the most significant sculptors of the end of the Roman Seicento he dedicated his last years in Rome to the pope Clement XI and the papal basilica before his return to Paris in 1705 where he worked for the Sun King and the ‘Maisons’ of Meudon and Marly. With the same maestria Jean-Baptiste Théodon carved allegories for Colbert, mythological and historical figures for Louis XIV, funeral sculptures and portrait for Christine of Sweden as well as works of art for Roman churches. The Ph.D. dissertation consists of a study of the career of the sculptor with an analysis of his artistic manner and its evolution from Paris to Rome. In addition the thesis includes the complete ‘catalogue raisonné’ of his works, sculptures and drawings.","Titre provenant de l'écran-titre. - Thèse confidentielle jusqu'au 05 décembre 2013|Academic Department:  Art History|Advisor:  Mérot, Alain",,French,CULL|REVIEW

Tennyson's speakers are fractured selves focused on the gap between matter and spirit, faith and reason, solitude and community. Likewise, Hopkins' doubled vocation as priest and poet is presented as a contradiction to the point that the transition from his early nature sonnets to his later terrible sonnets is seen as analogous of that conflict. However, both poets tend to represent contraries through the figure of synoeciosis rather than antithesis. Synoeciosis is the coupling of two contraries without the intention to oppose them. Rather than being a contradiction for its own sake, synoeciosis serves to illuminate a hidden truth, much like its parent figure, paradox. In this thesis, the poetry of Tennyson and Hopkins are read through the hermeneutic of synoeciosis, with the purpose of moving beyond dialectical thinking. Following Hopkins' writings on mystery and Giorgio Agamben's presentation of the influence of Messianic time on poetry, this thesis proposes that the Incarnation, as the coupling of the divine and human natures of Christ, is the pattern that influences all forms of doubling for these poets.","|Advisor:  Anderson, W.

I analyze the profound conflicts between the state-sponsored French projects of trade and religion in the colony of Pondichéry in South India, and by doing so reveal the many internal contradictions that posed a challenge to French aspirations for colonial hegemony. This thesis is equally concerned with the roles filled by Tamil professional intermediaries, employed by French traders and missionaries alike. By juxtaposing an analysis of internal French struggles with a study of colonial go-betweens, the thesis reveals the inherent incompleteness of colonial authority. It thus contributes to our understanding of early modern empires, by suggesting that fluidly distributed and tenuously held authority are the hallmarks of such ventures. Scholars have studied early modern commercial and religious projects, but rarely in tandem. My project examines the relationship between these two efforts, and reveals that while traders of the French Compagnie des Indes and Catholic missionaries were both sent to India to advance the interests of the French Crown, agents of these groups were deeply divided about the goals and practice of empire. I argue that while traders sought to sustain the profitable status quo and insert themselves into long-standing Indian Ocean trading networks based on kinship and confession, French missionaries, and particularly the Jesuits, espoused an ideology of disruption and radical change, in an effort to reconfigure the local spiritual and social hierarchies. As a result of these fissures among the French, Tamil commercial brokers and religious interpreters were able find a central and influential place in the conflicted crevices of the French project. While recent scholarly focus on colonial mediation has studied interactions between colonizers and colonized, this project demonstrates that a study of the lives and labors of local intermediaries also sheds lights on the internal contestations which shaped the French imperial endeavor. By examining the global project of empire through a resolutely local lens, I show that the colonizing experience is not one that simply divides colonizer and colonized, but rather creates fractures within imperial institutions and among colonizing agents.",,,English,KEEP|REVIEW

O objetivo é compreender como foi sendo construída esta disciplina, quais os fatores que influenciaram essa construção e, a partir deste estudo, num lócus específico, estabelecer relações com a construção social dessa disciplina no Brasil naquele período. A metodologia empregada foi a da pesquisa histórica, tendo como pressuposto a compreensão ampliada da noção de documento. As fontes analisadas foram livros didáticos e artigos escritos pelos padres/professores, relatórios do Ginásio, jornais de circulação da época, documentos oficiais, bem como foram realizadas entrevistas com ex-alunos que estudaram no Ginásio naquele período. A fundamentação teórica a partir da qual esta pesquisa foi estruturada baseia-se nos estudos sobre História das Disciplinas Escolares (HDE), especialmente nos trabalhos de Ivor Goodson. Algumas das contribuições desta pesquisa consistem em fazer emergir questões pouco exploradas na historiografia da Educação brasileira, como a mudança ocorrida na formação dos jesuítas no final do século XIX, a qual se refletiu na construção das disciplinas da área das Ciências Físicas e Biológicas no período anterior à década de cinqüenta do século XX, na região sul do Brasil. No entanto, a questão fundamental que perpassa todo este trabalho consiste na discussão sobre a relação entre os objetivos do ensino secundário propostos no currículo oficial e a pouca relevância social que caracterizava (ou ainda caracteriza) a disciplina escolar Química no currículo real do ensino secundário brasileiro.||The purpose in this research is to build the history of the school discipline chemistry in a secondary teaching institution, in the period 1909 to 1942. The search is to understand how this discipline was being constructed, which factors influenced this construction and, by the study in a specific locus, establish connections with the social construction of this discipline in Brazil, at that period. The methodology applied was historical research, having as purpose, the amplified comprehension of document notion. The sources analyzed were didactic books and articles written by priest/professors, Secondary school reports, newspapers from that period and official documents. Interviews were realized with ex-students who took Secondary education at that period in that School. The theoretical basis supporting this research was structured on the history of School Disciplines, especially on Ivor Goodsons works. Some of these contributions consisted in bringing into view questions not much explored in Brazilian education historiography, like the change in the Jesuits formation at the end of XIX century, which reflected on the construction of the disciplines of the area of Physics and Biology Sciences in the period before the decade of the 50 s in the XX century, in the South region of Brazil. However, the main question in this work consists in a discussion about the connection between the objectives of secondary education proposed in the formal curriculum and the small social relevance that characterized (or still characterizes) the Chemistry School discipline on the real curriculum of Brazilian Secondary education.","|Academic Department:  Scientific Education and Technology|Advisor:  Ern, Edel",,Portuguese,CULL|REVIEW

O período de transição da educação no Brasil colônia foi enfocado a partir de dois métodos norteadores das diretrizes conceituais e educacionais, são eles: o Ratio studiorum, da educação jesuíta e O Verdadeiro Método de Estudar de Verney, da educação laica. Fundada por Inácio de Loyola, em 1534, a Companhia de Jesus estabeleceu prioridades pedagógicas basicamente voltadas à educação de novas gerações e à ação missionária de difusão dos valores religiosos, sendo que, nessas duas instâncias a música teve papel relevante na perspectiva da relação ensino-aprendizagem da educação religiosa. Verney, conforme relata a historiografia, teve um papel central para compreensão do movimento iluminista português, norteador da reforma pombalina, pois através de sua obra, mobilizou novos rumos para educação de Portugal e suas colônias, compatíveis com o pensamento vigente na Europa do século XVIII. Com a reforma pombalina a música foi minimizada no ambiente escolar, ocupando outros espaços e criando estilos diferenciados, tanto no que diz respeito à produção musical sacra quanto à profana. O Brasil Colônia obteve representatividade musical na Europa, pela qualidade de seus músicos-compositores mulatos, em especial os de Minas Gerais, Bahia, Pernambuco e sacros em Mogi das Cruzes.||This thesis proposes reading music as a resource for teaching, from the analysis of the methodological clash between the Jesuit Education and the Pombal Education, immediately following the educational reform proposed by the Marquis of Pombal. The educational transition in Colonial Brazil was focused on two guiding methods of conceptual and educational guidelines, they are: the Jesuit Ratio studiorum and Verney's True Method of Studying, of secular education. Founded by Ignatius of Loyola in 1534, the Society of Jesus establishes educational priorities primarily focused on education of new generations and the missionary work of infusing religious values, being that in these two instances music has played a significant role in the perspective in teaching or having a religious education. Verney, as reported by historians, played a central role in understanding Portuguese Age of Enlightenment, leading the reform of Pombal, because it was with his work that new directions for education were mobilized in Portugal and its colonies, befitting of the prevailing thought in eighteenth-century Europe. With the Pombal Reform the music was oppressed in school environments, occupying other spaces and creating differentiated styles, with regard to music production being sacred as well as profane. Colonial Brazil won musical acknowledgement in Europe for its mulatto musician-composers predicate, especially those of Minas Gerais, Bahia, Pernambucco and Mogi das Cruzez.","|Academic Department:  Social History|Advisor:  Peralta, Inez Garbuio|Albieri, Sara|Andrade, Wilma Therezinha Fernandes de|Ferreira, João Martins|Silva, Janice Theodoro da",,Portuguese,CULL|REVIEW

O arco temporal compreende os anos de 1653 (estabelecimento da Companhia de Jesus em Belém) a 1759 (expulsão dos jesuítas das colônias portuguesas). A tese enfoca, em particular, o trabalho artístico de jesuítas e índios nas oficinas que funcionaram no Colégio Jesuítico de Santo Alexandre em Belém a partir do século XVIII; procurando identificar a irradiação de modelos criados nas mesmas em direção às igrejas e capelas implantadas pelos jesuítas ao longo do Rio Amazonas e seus afluentes; sobretudo, àquelas que estavam localizadas em vilas, aldeias ou fazendas jesuíticas mais próximas a Belém (Vila de Nossa Senhora de Nazaré da Vigia, Vila Souza do Caeté, Mortigura, Gibirié, Mamaiacú, Jaguarari, entre outras). É colocada a hipótese de que Belém, como um pólo criador de modelos (também pólo econômico e comercial), alimentou toda a produção artística dos jesuítas no Grão-Pará, ao difundir seus métodos de trabalho e suas experiências técnicas. O título Tintas da Terra, Tintas do Reino sintetiza a idéia central da tese, de que o legado dos jesuítas na arquitetura e na arte nas missões do Grão-Pará é resultado do trabalho de europeus e de índios, e do emprego de suas tradições culturais.||This thesis is a study of the artistic and architectural production of the Jesuit Missions in the former State of Maranhão and Grão Pará, which was established in 1621, with a special emphasis on the Captaincy of Grão Pará. The period under study spans the time from 1653, when the Society of Jesus settled in the city of Belém, to 1759, when the Jesuits were expelled from Portuguese colonies. This thesis focuses in particular on the artistic work of both jesuits and indians carried out in the workshops at the Jesuit School of Santo Alexandre in Belém in the 18th century. The thesis seeks to trace the dissemination of the models created in such workshops throughout the Jesuit churches and chapels that were built along the borders of the River Amazon and its tributaries, especially those located in the Jesuit aldeias, vilas and fazendas closer to Belém (Vila de Nossa Senhora de Nazaré da Vigia, Vila Souza do Caeté, Mortigura, Gibirié, Mamaiacú, Jaguarari, among others). The hypothesis under investigation in this study is that Belém, in addition to being an economic and commercial hub, was also an artistic center providing models, working methods and technical expertise for the entire Jesuit artistic community in the Grão Pará. The title Tintas da Terra, Tintas do Reino summarizes the core idea underlying this thesis, namely that the Jesuit legacy in the art and architecture of the Grão Pará missions is the result of the work of europeans and indians, who in doing so resorted to their respective cultural traditions.","|Academic Department:  History and Fundamentals of Architecture and Urbanism|Advisor:  Migliaccio, Luciano|Baumgarten, Jens Michael|Marx, Murillo de Azevedo|Mota, Carlos Guilherme Santos Seroa da|Oliveira, Myriam Andrade Ribeiro de",,Portuguese,CULL|REVIEW

He went on to be ordained a Jesuit priest and to make an outstanding contribution to the musical life of the institutions he lived and taught in, notably the English College at Saint-Omer, in Spanish Flanders. Poole's output will be shown to be of importance in the history of seventeenth-century instrumental music, especially in the context of the development of the sonata in England and division-viol music in Europe. His music has not been collected, catalogued or studied before, and this thesis presents it against the backdrop of several generations of English musicians who spent all or part of their working lives abroad. The significance of migrant musicians is often neglected by comparison with that of native musicians, perhaps because the latter fit our perceptions of national styles better, and this thesis goes some way towards appraising that contribution. The bass viol, or the 'Brittanica Chelys' in the words of the expatriate Latin poet Dr John Alban Gibbes, was an instrument with strong Catholic and Royalist resonances in England, and extemporising divisions on it became in post- Thirty- Y ears-War Europe a quintessentially English art, as will be shown in chapter one. Chapter two presents as full a biographical account as is possible at present, and chapter three considers all extant sources of Poole's music, exploring how his works made their way to the exiled court at Saint-Germain-en-Laye, the library of Phillip Falle, the viol-playing circle of William Noble in Oxford, and elsewhere in England. This thesis contains therefore a significant contribution to our understanding of the history of English Jesuit music, the court of James Il, and the circulation of Continental music in Restoration England. Chapter four is a stylistic discussion of the music, its influences and reception, and the appendix consists of a thematic index of Poole's works.",|Academic Department:  Music,,English,KEEP|REVIEW

Bush administration, American involvement in El Salvador's civil war, one of the last Cold War battlegrounds, had disappeared from the foreign policy agenda. However, two events in November 1989 shattered the bipartisan consensus on US policy toward El Salvador: the failure of the FMLN's largest military offensive of the war and the murder of six Jesuit priests, their housekeeper, and her daughter by the Salvadoran military, the FAES. Despite more than one billion dollars in US military assistance, the war had stalemated, promoting both sides to seek a negotiated political settlement mediated by the United Nations. The Jesuit murders demonstrated the failure of the policy of promoting respect for democracy and human rights and revived the debate in Congress over US aid to El Salvador. This thesis argues that the Bush administration sought to remove the burden of El Salvador from its foreign policy agenda by actively pushing for the investigation and prosecution of the Jesuit case and fully supporting the UN-mediated peace process. Using recently declassified government documents from the George Bush Presidential Library, this thesis will examine how the Bush administration fundamentally changed US policy toward El Salvador. Administration officials carried out an unprecedented campaign to pressure the FAES to investigate the Jesuit murders and bring the killers to justice while simultaneously attempting to prevent Congress from cutting American military assistance. The Bush administration changed the objective of its El Salvador policy from military victory over the guerrillas to a negotiated political settlement. The US facilitated the peace process by pressuring the Salvadoran government and the FMLN to negotiate in good faith and accept compromises. When both sides signed a comprehensive peace agreement on January 16, 1992, the burden of El Salvador was lifted.",,,English,KEEP|REVIEW

The perceptions of the presidents and their administrative teams and faculties were compared for congruency.|The study employed mixed methodologies in two phases. The first phase used a researcher-designed survey in two versions: The Presidents' Jesuit Education and Leadership Survey and the Administration and Faculty Jesuit Education and Leadership Survey. The second phase considered a group of interviews using a standardized open-ended interview guide in two versions: The Jesuit University Presidents Interview Guide and the Jesuit Administrative and Faculty Interview Guide. The survey was administered to seven Jesuit university presidents, 210 administrators and 210 full-time and part-time faculty members. A sample of four presidents, eight senior administrators and eight faculty members was selected for face-to-face interviews in the second phase of the study.|The study found that the leadership styles vary according to the presidents' personality and approach to the institution. The results revealed that an authoritarian leadership will limit the achievement of the Jesuit mission and the university institutional goals. The findings delineated that having greater knowledge of the Jesuit mission and of presidential role, along with collaborative and delegative leadership styles, will result in better institutional outcomes. The study offered recommendations and direction to current efforts made in presidency leadership in higher education in the Mexican Province.",|Academic Department:  Leadership Studies,,English,KEEP|REVIEW

This study attempts to contribute to a deeper understanding of the Blessed Virgin Mary both as Mother of God and Mother of all Christians in the light of the theologies of four theologians representative of the Orthodox Christian East and the Roman Catholic West. It presupposes that the Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic Churches' deeper understanding of important common elements can enable Eastern and Western Christians to mutually recognise themselves in each other, and in so doing advance the movement towards the restoration of their full visible communion. This study aims to investigate the profound significance of the Virgin Mother as both Mother of the Divine Redeemer and as Mother of all Christians, examining in particular the relationship of Mary and the Holy Spirit in the theologies of Sergius Bulgakov (1871–1944), Alexander Schmemann (1921–1983), John Henry Newman (1801–1890) and Hans Urs von Balthasar (1905–1988).

This period, which has been neglected for a long time by historiography, is characterised by a deep controversy concerning the juridical status of the Amerindians who were evangelized by the Jesuits in separated villages, the aldeamentos. Father António Vieira’s arrival, in 1653, at the strategically important colony of Maranhão and Grão-Pará only stirred up the quarrel because the settlers and the civil authorities claimed the Indians as servile labour force, specially as rowers and pickers of rain forest products. After a period of uncertainty, Father Jean-Philippe Bettendorff obtained, in 1686, the promulgation of a law that defined the working conditions of the Indian neophytes and gave a large autonomy to the aldeamentos. This missionary from Luxembourg was also an outstanding personality in the Amazon region as religious superior, chronicler, lawyer, economist and architect.","|Advisor:  Alencastro, Luiz Felipe",,French,CULL|REVIEW

L'analyse de ces sources, en grande partie inédites - rapports des missionnaires jésuites, actes de l'Inquisition, synodes, pregoni, pragmatiques, actes du Parlement, registres des douanes, actes notariés et fonds paroissiaux - a permis d'abandonner la vision univoque d'une minorité irréductible, persécutée sans trêve et marginale. En particulier, nous avons analysé les relations qui liaient, entre eux et avec les autres populations, les groupes tsiganes sardes, et montré comment leurs relations avec les institutions insulaires étaient articulées et se développaient à différents niveaux, non seulement doctrinal et répressif mais aussi économique et social. Nous avons souligné l'importance des évènements rituels qui scandaient leur vie religieuse, et constituaient un formidable dispositif de construction symbolique qui cimentait l'appartenance des tsiganes à la communauté locale, à travers un vaste réseau de relations, échanges, alliances. Nous avons enfin mis en évidence, grâce à la comparaison avec des documents provenant d'autres territoires, le fait que le processus d'implantation des populations tsiganes en Sardaigne se liait à un processus plus général qui concerne toute la Méditerranée, et que la circulation des groupes n'avait pas toujours un caractère diasporique mais faisait partie de stratégies de mobilité diversifiées. Par conséquent, nous proposons un changement de paradigme interprétatif permettant d'aller au-delà des reconstructions traditionnelles.||This thesis analyses the presence in Sardinia of Gypsy groups, in the early modern era (16th–17th century), by looking at a broad range of primary sources, mostly unpublished: Jesuit missionary reports, acts of the Inquisition, synod proceedings, pregones, pragmaticas, acts of Parliament, customs records, notarial deeds and parish funds. Studying these sources allows us to move beyond the reductive vision of the Gypsies as an indomitable minority that was relentlessly persecuted and marginal. In particular, we have analyzed the social relations of Sardinian Gypsy groups (both) among themselves and with the other residents, and we have highlighted how their relationship with the island institutions was articulated, and developed not only at a doctrinal and repressive level, but also economically and socially. We have highlighted the importance of ritual events wich marked their religious life, while being at the same time an important device in the symbolic construction that cemented the Gypsy's belonging to the local community through a vast network of relations, economic exchange and alliances. Finally, through a comparison with documents from other geographical areas, this thesis demonstrates that the process of settlement of Gypsy populations in Sardinia is linked to a process existing throughout the Mediterranean as a whole, and that the circulation of these groups did not always have a diaphoric character, but was part of a wider range of mobility strategies. Therefore, this thesis proposes a shift in the interpretative paradigm, in order to move beyond the limitations of many traditional reconstructions.","|Advisor:  Vincent, Bernard",,French,CULL|REVIEW

In dialogue with Dionysius the Areopagite and Hans Urs von Balthasar, this thesis aims at answering this question. I first assess Dionysius's aesthetic theology,"" with its invitation that we respond to beauty's upward call, as issued by Christ's Incarnation, and so join all of creation in cooperatively manifesting God's own glory. I then turn to Balthasar and examine his ""aesthetic Christology,"" through which he seeks to preserve the integrity of aesthetics for theology -- concentrating most obviously on the appearance of Christ -- while dealing sufficiently with the problem of evil and the reality of suffering. In my final chapter, I reframe my initial question to ask how our present perception of Christ in his earthly ministry relates us to the eschatological vision of God (the beatific vision). Specifically, I explore how our ""aesthetic appreciation"" of Christ's earthly ministry relates to our supernatural hope of seeing Christ in his fully glorified and exalted form, as suggested by John: ""Dear friends, now we are children of God, and what we will be has not yet been made known. But we know that when Christ appears, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is"" (1 John 3:2–3; NIV). I conclude by arguing that the difference Christ makes to our perception of beauty is this: Christ not only manifests the vision of God in our humanity but also actively mediates the eschatological vision of God, bringing us to that day when we shall see him as he is, and so enjoy the summit and source of all beauty ""face to face.""--Abstract.",,,English,CULL|REVIEW

Curral de reses tece as questões do fenômeno urbano no interior do Nordeste açucareiro, no que dizia respeito ao papel exercido pela pecuária extensiva no povoamento, na posse da terra e no desenvolvimento de aglomerados urbanos criados ao longo dos caminhos elaborados pelo gado. As reses tangidas do litoral devassaram o hinterland nordestino, criando aqui, ali e além caminhos, desmistificando o desconhecido. Posteriormente, essas trilhas foram usadas pelas autoridades coloniais e clericais para erguer aldeamentos missioneiros - currais de almas -, visando o bem material e espiritual da Igreja e da Ordem de Cristo e a conversão dos nativos. Curral de almas busca esclarecer a ação da Igreja Católica, unida ao Estado português, no que cerce a fixação e congregação tanto do índio tapuia como dos sertanejos nômades (que ""vadiavam"" pelo território), primeiramente em aldeamentos missioneiros, depois em núcleos urbanos estrategicamente locados no território. Focalizamos o trabalho missionário dos jesuítas, capuchinhos e oratorianos na elaboração de reduções religiosas principiadas a partir da segunda metade do século XVII.

Curral de Reses (Cattle Corral) investigates the several aspects of urbanization in the sugar-producing Northeast, relating it to the role of extensive cattle ranges in the process of population growth, to the land ownership and to the development of hamlets alongside the herding trails. The herds pushed from the coast, broke through the Brazilian northeasterner hinterland, creating hither, thither and yonder new pathways, therefore demystifying the unknown. Later in time, these trails were used by colonial and clerical authorities to start missionary settlements - ""Currais de Almas"" (Souls' Corrals)- that aimed at the material and spiritual welfare of the Church and the Order of Christ and the conversion of the native peoples. ""Curral de Almas"" investigates the activity of the Catholic Church associated to the portuguese government as the ""Tapuia "" native people and the itinerant cowboys (who ""bummed"" around the land) settled and congregated at first in missions and later in strategically located urban centers. Another focal point has been the investigation of the missionary work of Jesuit and Capuchin friars as well as ""The Congragation of the Oratory"" in the construction of religious settlements as early as the second half of the 17th century. The town of ""Oeiras"" (PI) -created by the Marquis of Pombal- and the Indian villages ""Monte-Mor o Novo da América"" (CE) and ""Crato""(CE) were selected as case studies, attempting to analyze the influence of cattle industry, herding trails, determinations from Lisbon and the church in the planning of the urban center.",|Advisor:  Luciano Migliaccio,,Portuguese,CULL|REVIEW

In that century of Enlightenment, these events – known as transits of Venus – attracted massive interest from the entire world of learning. The monograph ""Maximilianus Hell (1720–1792) and the Eighteenth-Century Transits of Venus. A Study of Jesuit Science in Nordic and Central-European Contexts"" is a source-based, historical case study that aims to explore and contextualise Venus transit activities in the Nordic countries and Central Europe. It traces the scientific career of an individual, Maximilianus Hell, and analyses the conditions for astronomical research in areas presently known as Slovakia, Austria, Romania, Hungary, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland and Russia. It presents numerous primary sources and also has a separate part with editions of Latin texts. This is the first full-scale, contextualised study of the Jesuit Father Maximilianus Hell in the English language. New sources, not only on Father Hell, but also on the institutional history of astronomy in Central and Nordic regions of Europe are presented. The thesis is also pioneering in the sense that it covers areas that have until now been neglected or at least ill-understood in the Anglo- and Francophone historiography on the eighteenth-century transits of Venus. By ‘breaking down national barriers’ and employing a comparative perspective, it offers new insight into the different conditions for astronomical research in each country or region covered. Examination of archival sources and literature in various languages – primarily in Latin, Swedish, Danish, Russian, French and German – has been vital here. Hopefully, this study may prove helpful to the formation of a fuller and more nuanced understanding of the Venus transit projects of the eighteenth century, seen as an international enterprise.",,,English,KEEP|REVIEW

Après cette première moitié du XVIIe siècle, l’œuvre comme son auteur tombèrent dans l’oubli et ne connurent pas de nouvelle publication. Ce n’est qu’à partir de la fin XIXe siècle que les critiques, notamment Henri Brémond commencèrent à s’intéresser à Richeome et à son travail, mais sans pour autant y consacrer un ouvrage ou une édition critique. Cette thèse se propose donc de redécouvrir un ouvrage religieux à part, oscillant entre le catéchisme, les méditations, le récit de pèlerinage et le roman d’aventures. Pour ce travail, nous avons choisi l’édition bordelaise de Simon Millanges de 1604 qui comporte quatorze illustrations. L’édition et l’analyse de ce texte et de ses images nous permettent de mieux comprendre les influences et les enjeux d’un ouvrage qui s’inscrit résolument dans le contexte religieux et politique du début du XVIIe siècle.||In 1604, the Jesuit Louis Richeome (1544–1625) published for the first time Le Pelerin de Lorete. The book was re-edited several times and was translated in three languages until 1628. Le Pelerin de Lorete was considered a best-seller for its time in France. Despite this initial success, the book remained unstudied until the late 19th century. Among the first literary critics to study Le Pelerin de Lorete was Henri Brémond (1865–1933). However, to date there is no critical edition of the book. Thus, this study proposes a new reading of Le Pelerin de Lorete as a religious book that oscillates between a catechism and a guide to spiritual meditation and between a pilgrimage account and an adventure novel. Moreover, by providing for the first time a visual and textual analysis of the book, we uncover the historical and religious context that made possible this unique piece.","|Advisor:  Duché-Gavet, Véronique",,French,CULL|REVIEW

F., 1904–1984","This work is grounded in a moral horizon constructed around the worldview of emergent probability as central to a generalized theory of evolution reaching finality in the Trinity, in Otto Friedman's transdisciplinary framework for professional practice transposed into the realm of the transcendent, in Bernard Lonergan's transdisciplinary method in Insight and Method , and in an analysis of core problems in contemporary society. All these elements, when used as a guide to an encounter with the incarnate meaning of Thomas Müntzer, make explicit the horizons and intentions of the author as they relate to different levels of conversion required for intelligent, reasonable and responsible action during times of fundamental institutional change. This study offers one concrete approach to objectifying such foundations, where the heuristic notion of an encounter with the meaning of another's life provides data for objectifying one's own foundations. This objectified intentionality can then be used to expand one's horizon and intentions or initiate a shift to a higher viewpoint. This work operates not at the level of common sense understanding but in the explanatory theoretical realm of meaning grounded in a working knowledge of the realm of interiority. My encounter partner is Thomas Müntzer, an early 16th century German reformer whose commitment to Church and God fills a grey area in my own scientific and policy-making background. Evaluating and extending my positions vis-Ã -vis Müntzer's foundations is the immediate task; knowing exactly how to do this is the general theme. The subject matter is neither MÃ¼ntzer nor the Reformation, although both are extensively researched, but my own foundational stance.

The emblem form has been considered from the perspective of individual author, geographical factors and theological background but there have been few comparative studies with respect to religious emblems. This study will compare Protestant and Catholic emblems produced during the Reformation and Counter- Reformation, drawing on specific examples from, in particular, France, but also Germany and England. Emblems played a huge role in early modern life. They expressed contemporary thought and also became part of the physical environment, being etched into stone, or wood, or sewn into cloth as decoration. In a period of such political, civil, and religious unrest, it would, therefore, seem likely that the Catholic and Protestant emblem would be quite distinct types either expressing theologically opposed notions, or manipulating the text/image relationship in quite different ways. Understanding how these emblems functioned, therefore, necessitates close reading, indeed, reading in the way the emblems were intended to be read. This study, therefore, will address the question of differences through detailed analysis of specific examples. This study begins with an introduction which gives a brief history of emblem literature and a review of relevant secondary material. Key terms and definitions regarding emblems are also explained here. This chapter also introduces the authors of the emblems analysed in later chapters. The first part of this thesis examines the emblem form in the wider context of the Reformation. From an initial overview of some of the key issues of the Reformation in chapter one, chapters two and three move on to analyse closely a wide corpus of Catholic and Protestant emblems. In these chapters the emblem is broken down into its component parts of verse and picture. Chapter two examines the religious emblem from the perspective of motif while chapter three approaches the emblem from a thematic angle. The second part of this study adopts a different approach presenting case studies of three authors. Chapter four explores the importance of the visual element in the emblems of Protestant author Rollenhagen. Chapter five investigates the Jesuit influences which shape the emblems of Catholic Berthod. While chapters four and five offer an insight into the work of prototypical Protestant and Catholic authors chapter six demonstrates the successful fusion of both Protestant and Catholic influences in the emblems of Wither. Indeed, this study suggests that the differences between Protestant and Catholic at this time are largely exaggerated with respect to emblems. Protestant and Catholic emblems are not, this study maintains, in essence all that different. It argues that, in fact, Protestant and Catholic emblems were often very close in terms of content and that the real difference is in the way they manipulate the text/image relationship.",|Academic Department:  French,,English,KEEP|REVIEW

Nous montrons que les pères jésuites s'appuient sur les productions littéraires de leurs écrivains profesionnels (scriptores liborum) et sur l'outil journalistique des ""Mémoiresé et du ""Dictionnaire universel"" de Trévoux pour concrétiser leur projet pédagogique d'investir les savoirs scientifiques et historique, afin de répondre aux difficultés rencontrées aves les propositions philosophiques nouvelles. Les jésuites s'attachent à définir plusieurs notions traitées par la physique (l'attraction, la matière, etc.), tout comme ils tentent de préciser la fonction des fables, de la mythologie antique et de justifier la grande ancienneté de la chronologie biblique face à la découverte des annales chinoises. en même temps, les pères abordent plusieurs questions fondées sur la notion de secret (pierre philosophale, cure magnétique, poudre de sympathie, baguette divinatoire, kabbale, prophéties, oracles, emblèmes, énigmes, etc.) qui, à ce titre, se rattachent aux thématiques ésotériques. S'il s'agit pour eux de susciter un débat propice au déploiement d'un discours rhétorique, plutôt que d'affronter directement les arguements adverses, ces derniers s'efforcent de récupérer telle ou telle thématique au gré des opportunités dans le but de l'utiliser pour justifier leurs propres idées, ce qui cache mal leur difficulté à bâtir une doctrine globale cohérente. Une stratégie ambigüe dont l'enjeu est double. D'une part, il est nécessaire d'apporter des réponses aux attaques protestantes qui cherchent à ruiner la crédibilité tant des Pères de l'Eglise que du dogme trinitaire et, partant, menacent lza tradition catholique. D'autre part, les jésuites doivent préserver les mystère cachés d'une nature créee par Dieu, au risque de soutenir des positions scientifiques obsolètes.||The object of this thesis is to look for the place of the esoteric themes in the strategy of Jesuits to carry out, in the animated context of the France in the turn of the XVIIIth century, their pastoral mission of defence of the catholic tradition, determinated at the council of Trent. We show that the Jesuit fathers lean on the literary productions of their professionnal writers (scriptores librorum) and th journalistic tool of the ""Mémoires"" and the ""Dictionnaire universel"" de Trévoux, to concretize their pedagogical project to invest the scientific and historical knowledges, to reply to the met difficulties coming up against the new philosophical propositions. The Jesuits attempt to define several notions discussed by the physics (attraction, matter, etc.), quite as they try o specify the function of the fables of the antique mythology and to prove the great antiquity of the biblical chronology facing the discovery of the chinese annals. At the same time, the fathers approach several questions based on the notion of secret (philosopher's stone, magnetic cure, powder with sympathy, divinatory baguette, cabala, propheties, oracles, emblems, enigmae), which as such are connected with the esoteric themes. On the one hand, it is necessary to answer to the Protestant criticisms who try to ruin the cridibility of the Fathers of the Church as Trinitarian Dogma, and, consequently, to threaten the catholic tradition. On the other hand, the Jesuits have to protect the hidden mysteries of a nature created by God, at the risk of support obsolete scientifical positions.","|Advisor:  Brach, Jean-Pierre",,French,CULL|REVIEW

It argues that in both corporeal and textual forms, missionaries put their passions to use in the pacification of the northern frontier of Mexico. It also correlates colonial martyrologies to longer traditions of redemptive death in the history of Christianity.

The beginning of this renewal is marked by the work of Karl Rahner who, before the Second Vatican Council, decried the fact that Roman Catholicism, in contrast to the Protestant theological tradition, lacked an adequate theology of the word. Relying on a Roman Catholic theology of grace, Rahner's work, along with that of sacramental theologian Louis-Marie Chauvet, demonstrates the Roman Catholic conviction that the word is fundamentally sacramental: it has the capacity to bear God's presence to humanity.|This dissertation examines the contributions of Rahner and Chauvet, contextualizing them within the larger Christian tradition, and identifying ways in which their contributions advanced a Roman Catholic theology of the word. To that end, the first chapter describes the twentieth-century context. The second chapter treats classical sacramental theology: the work of Augustine and Thomas Aquinas. Here words are identified as types of signs, and similarities between classical approaches to God's revelation found in scripture and in the sacraments are demonstrated. The third chapter considers the work of Reformation theologians Martin Luther and John Calvin. These figures emphasize that the scriptural word is also the sacramental word of promise; they grapple with the necessity of material elements to mediate God's grace in a fallen world. The fourth chapter examines Rahner's efforts to demonstrate the relationship between word and sacrament by contextualizing them within an understanding of an already graced world in which language is the privileged place of the self-expression of God. The fifth chapter examines Chauvet's work, focusing on the sacramentality of language, culture, and creation, yet emphasizing the radical absence of the body of the Risen Christ. Christians are formed by the word into the body of Christ through participation in liturgy and maintenance of a sacramental world. The conclusion compares these approaches, and analyzes their implications for Trinitarian theology, sacramentality, and the understanding of the relationship between word and sacrament. It suggests that the principle of sacramentality is a necessary consideration for Roman Catholic theologies of the word.","|Academic Department:  Theology|Advisor:  Hilkert, Mary Catherine",,English,KEEP|REVIEW

Thus, he creates a prose work that ministered to Catholic souls, appealed to Protestant audiences, and initiated the literature of tears in England. Southwell readapts the traditional image of Mary Magdalene for a Catholic Early Modern audience by utilizing the techniques of Jesuit meditation, which later flourished in the weeper texts of Richard Crashaw and George Herbert. His vividly imagined scenes also employ the Petrarchan and Ovidian language of longing and absence and coincide with both traditional and mystic early church writers such as Bernard and Augustine. Through this combination, Southwell’s Marie Magdalens Funeral Teares resonated with Catholics deprived of both ministry and the presence of Christ in the Eucharist. These contributions solidify Southwell’s place as a pivotal figure in the religious and literary contexts of Early Modern England.","|Academic Department:  English|Advisor:  Erickson, Wayne",,English,KEEP|REVIEW

Chegaram poucos anos após os comerciantes portugueses, mas não ficaram sob sua proteção. Ao contrário destes, não ficaram apenas nas cidades portuárias, mas adentraram-se no território japonês que passava por um século de sangrentas guerras, num longo processo de unificação do território por um poder central, que só terminaria no século seguinte. Os jesuítas, ordem que manteve o monopólio da evangelização do Japão até o ano de 1593, acabaram por se envolver no complexo jogo político de então, à procura de patronos e proteção para que pudessem espalhar o Evangelho dentre a população nativa. Sem qualquer proteção garantida a maneira que encontraram para cristianizar os japoneses foi implicarem-se na política local tentando convencê-los de que o cristianismo era a verdadeira religião. A forma como se deveria dar esse processo de convencimento não foi, contudo, consenso entre os jesuítas, que acabaram se dividindo acerca do melhor método. Se de um lado o Visitador Geral das Índias Orientais, Alexandre Valignano, formulou um método inovador, denominado pelo próprio como acomodação (ou accomodattio em italiano), uma outra parcela da ordem, encabeçada pelo segundo superior da missão japonesa, Francisco Cabral, discordava, afirmando que o processo de evangelização deveria sempre priorizar os regramentos da Ordem para não correr o perigo de extraviar a mensagem. O objetivo da presente dissertação é, portanto, mapear e compreender essas duas diferentes estratégias de evangelização, tanto para a missão para a qual foi criada, no Japão, quanto para os seus agentes, os jesuítas.||In 1549, the first Christian missionaries arrived in Japan to evangelize the natives. They arrived some yearsafter the Portuguese traders, but did not stay under their protection. On the contrary, the missionaries entered the Japanese territory by their selves, while the traders stayed only in the port cities. At that time Japan was emerged in many civil wars in a period called Sengoku Jidai (the country at war). The Jesuits the denomination that hold the monopoly of the Japanese mission until 1593 saw their selves involved in a complicated political plot. As they could not count on any secular protection, they chose to look for the warlords (daimy) protection to accomplish the evangelization of the Japanese people. The only way for that was the convincement of the people that Christianity was the true religion. Nevertheless, even among the Jesuits that went to the Japanese mission, there was not a consensus about the best way to convince the Japanese to become Christians. The Visitor of the Jesuits missions in Asia, Alexandre Valignano, designed a new method called accomodatio, but some Jesuits were against it. Led by the second Superior of the Japanese mission, Francisco Cabral, they claimed that accomodatio was not the best way once it could mislead the neophytes. What they should do, in Cabrals point of view, was to follow strictly the rules of the Society of Jesus. The aim of this essay is to understand these two methods of evangelization and their meaning for both the Jesuits and the Japanese.","|Academic Department:  Filosofia, Letras e Ciências Humanas|Advisor:  Zeron, Carlos Alberto de Moura Ribeiro",,Portuguese,CULL|REVIEW

In other words, this research study proposed to provide a group of students with a space and opportunity for a 'calling to attend' experience of God; that is, an experience that was compelling.

The development of this research study therefore: established the context within which the study was situated; discussed a theological framework from Hans Urs von Balthasar and its links with this research study; examined the theory of Bernard Lonergan that art was a carrier of meaning for religious experience; discussed the role of revelation, aesthetic and religious experience and the religious imagination located within the 'graced nature' concept of Catholic theology; and sought to determine the contribution such a learning experience could make to the religious development of post-compulsory students in a boys' senior secondary college.

La présente démarche vise à comprendre les appropriations de l’écrit, la pluralité de ses interprétations et de ses usages. A Lyon, au XVIIe siècle, période considérée comme celle de l’entrée dans l’écrit (accroissement de l’enregistrement et du contrôle, inflation paperassière, constitution d’archives par les institutions), quels sont les usages de l'écrit, de quels statuts symboliques est-il investi ? L’accès croissant des individus à l’écrit, qu’il faut analyser précisément (temps, lieux, logiques de la diffusion selon les formes écrites) induit des changements, que l’on peut suivre selon trois perspectives. Inscrit dans un lieu, l’écrit a d’abord des effets sur l’appréhension de l’espace, que ce soit l’espace graphique, l’espace de l’édifice où il est inséré, de l’objet qui le supporte, ou l’espace de la ville. Il transforme ensuite les modalités des échanges marchands en s’imposant dans les transactions économiques les plus courantes, qui contribuent à familiariser la population urbaine avec son maniement. Il est enfin au cœur de la constitution d’une culture, culture de groupe ou d’individu, et des phénomènes identitaires qui l’accompagnent. Ces trois axes privilégient chaque fois des formes écrites différentes, pour certaines ancrées dans des traditions bibliographiques, écrits exposés, papiers, livres et ego-documents, correspondant aux modalités de leur appréhension (exposition, circulation, conservation).||This thesis attempts to approach the relationships between an urban population and literacy at a time characterised by an increase of writings and a resort even more important to writings (development of scribal proofs in justice, ""bureaucratization"", constitution of public archives). The gap between the capacity of reading and writing (which concerns a few persons) and the writing forms' expansion is the key of our investigation. In the seventeenth century, in the big town of Lyon, there are many ways to measure the inflation of writings and to understand their appropriations. First, we try to see how epitaphs, house names, shop signs, permanent and temporary inscriptions are surrounding the city, how the institutions (and principally the Municipality) product rules and resort to literate men like Jesuits to mark their names on Lyon's walls and buildings and to catch the power of the urban signs and doing so, how they contribute to create a public sphere. Then, we examine the question of the usual writings, contracts, receipts, economic and judiciary documents, which the common population is compelled to deal with. The trials of thefts of papers and of false documents inform about the appearance of a scribal proof's economy. At least, we question the social and cultural identity's build-up by the possession of printed books and by the act of writing (""ego-documents"").","|Academic Department:  History|Advisor:  Bayard, Françoise",,French,CULL|REVIEW

The contribution of this dissertation is to show how the fullest readings of Spenser's representations of Christianity must take into account the interplay between Protestant and Catholic semiotic values. Spenser reclaims some of the outward forms associated with Catholicism and invests them with inwardly Protestant significations to present them as inclusively, merely Christian. In Chapters One and Two I examine the effect of the controversies between Protestants and Catholics on Spenser's rhetorical strategies in his addresses to Lord Burghley, Queen Elizabeth, the Earl of Essex, and other dedicatees of The Faerie Queene. I compare Spenser's strategies with those of Jesuit Robert Persons, zealous Protestant George Gifford, and John Donne in his Pseudo-Martyr. In Chapter Three I argue that Spenser sets into play a dialectic between the competing values of the Protestant and Catholic camps in order to synthesize them. Spenser asks the reader to consider Catholic values from the Protestant perspective, and vice versa, in his depictions of the House of Holiness, St. George, and Arthur, in his representations of sacraments, in the dialogues of the February, May, and July eclogues of The Shepheardes Calender, and in his discussions of religion in Mother Hubberds Tale and A View of the Present State of Ireland. In Chapter Four I look at the analogies between the heated debates over how to interpret the Eucharist and Spenser's continual problematizing of how to read his poetic signs. The debate between Thomas Cranmer and Stephen Gardiner over the Eucharist guides my discussion, as does George Gifford's Dialogue between a Papist and a Protestant (1582). The work of Ferdinand de Saussure and Mikhail Bakhtin particularly influences my approach to semiotics.

Because Kircher covered the broadest range of musical topics and because he gained a worldwide readership, his work is especially useful in assessing learned inquiry into music during the seventeenth century. Clerics and courtiers like Kircher dominated the field, and their interests often diverged from those of composers and performers. In Kircher's time, learned musical researches were pursued in conjunction with others into mathematical and antiquarian matters. The nature and depth of Kircher's religious and institutional commitments were an important factor in distinguishing his musical studies from those of his contemporaries. The first chapter places Kircher in context and examines the genesis and early reception of Musurgia . Three subsequent chapters explore historical, theological, and scientific themes within his work. Kircher's researches into music history addressed contemporary debates over the merits of older music. In contrast to the humanist historiographical models adopted by most contemporary writers, Kircher traced music history according to the outlines of sacred history. Although his conclusions are now considered unreliable, they were widely discussed and debated as late as the 1770s. As with his historical views. Kircher's aesthetic theories were influenced by Jesuit liturgical and devotional practices. His music-technical language united theological and physical concepts that were themselves increasingly subject to scientific scrutiny. Kircher's researches into musical science rested upon the traditional understanding of music as a form of abstract mathematical knowledge, closely related to astronomy. Nevertheless, he attended to actual musical practice more closely than had earlier Jesuit mathematicians, and his treatment of musica mundana can be seen as having influenced the gradual separation of music from the quantitative disciplines of the quadrivium. Kircher's scientific practice, which emphasized wonders, prodigies, and spectacle, offers insight into seventeenth-century musical connoisseurship. The final chapter traces the fate of Musurgia , which remained a central work in its field for over a century. Patterns of readership changed as music came increasingly to be regarded as more an art than a science--a development to which Kircher himself contributed.",|Academic Department:  Music,,English,KEEP|REVIEW

F., 1904–1984","A wealth of recent scholarship has focused on interreligious dialogue as a resource for the transformation of religious conflicts. Such studies often mention the importance of discoveries or 'insights' as key factors in successful dialogue processes. However, few authors have devoted sustained attention to understanding how insights contribute to transforming conflict dynamics during interfaith dialogues. The present study draws on the cognitional theory of Canadian philosopher Bernard Lonergan as a framework for exploring the significance of insights in interreligious dialogue processes. The study begins with an overview of representative perspectives on learning in interfaith dialogue and conflict transformation. Following this, I offer a detailed analysis of Lonergan's work on insight in understanding, judgment, and practical learning, highlighting the important role that insights play in structuring interpretation and communication in dialogue situations. Drawing on Lonergan's theoretical framework, I explore how insights are implicated in shaping communication in dialogues between religious actors, both in the development of conflicts, as well as in their transformation. Using case studies from dialogues involving Christians, Muslims, and Jews, I examine how mistaken insights can contribute to sustaining relationships of threat among parties in religious conflicts. I then examine how dialogue processes can act as catalysts for the emergence of new and more accurate insights that transform parties' understanding of the conflict. By helping parties correct mistaken interpretations and discover alternate ways of communicating, such insights can often play an important role in facilitating shifts from hostile patterns of interaction to more cooperative forms of engagement. Throughout, I explain how Lonergan's work offers significant advances over existing discussions of insight and its role in conflict transformation processes. His approach identifies a range of different types of insights, and thus facilitates an analysis of the different roles insights can play in structuring communication at different phases of dialogue processes. It also permits a more developed exploration of the various cognitional and environmental conditions that facilitate or frustrate the occurrence of insights in dialogue situations. His work thus constitutes an important resource for theorists and practitioners seeking a better understanding of the cognitive dynamics that contribute to the transformation of interreligious dialogue processes.",|Academic Department:  Religious Studies,,English,CULL|REVIEW

The present work of comparative theology explores the body and divinization in Jesuit Pierre Teilhard de Chardin (1881–1955) and Daoist Xiao Yingsou (fl. Song Dynasty 960–1278). Early in his writing, Teilhard loses interest in discovering the theological significance of the human body in favor of addressing the fulfillment of the Cosmic Body of Christ. Accordingly, studies of Teilhard easily overlook the individual's body. This work derives a theory of the body and its role in divinization from Teilhard by introducing an anthropological category not present in traditional theological language. Shen, the experiencing body, is the word Xiao uses to describe the Daoist in the process of divinization. Shen challenges conventional notions of body, physicality, and their importance to Christian spiritual life. The experiencing body is a living community of souls in relationship to an essential soul, who receives bonding power from Christ. On their own, humans cannot maintain the relationships within themselves, but must surrender them to perfection in Christ. Biblically, Christian anthropology departed from a monistic to a tripartite view with Paul. In the early Church, Irenaeus and Augustine defended a unity of body and soul against the gnostics heresies. Later, Thomas Aquinas formulated a theory of the body as largely defined by the soul. The bodies did not give positive contributions to people's life in God. Teilhard inherited this view of the human, but was unsatisfied with it. At the same time, he read contemporary French philosophers who provided the spark he needed to develop his ideas on creation and divinization. Early in his writing, he considers the body in light of Christology and biology. He drops the question in favor of strengthening an argument for the divinization of the entire cosmos in the Cosmic Body of Christ. Nonetheless, in the pursuit of this answer, his writings imply the individual body. Human bodies most clearly appear in his mysticism of action, which he explains in The Divine Milieu. Teilhard cannot articulate the individual body because he lacks a cosmology that does not choose between non-subsistent matter and selfsubsistent spirit. Xiao Yingsou's commentary on Daoism's Scripture of Salvation provides such a cosmology. Xiao utilizes both word and image to describe a divinizing cosmic body using three terms: dong, ti, and shen. The individual's body in a process of perfection is shen. This body is not a static collection of interworking parts, but a movement of transformation that generates salvific energy for the entire cosmos. Shen highlights in Teilhard's work a body understood as a community interacting with other beings to perfect relationships in Christ. Therefore, the body is physical, but with Teilhard's expanded notion which exceeds the limitations of time and space. This view yields a body that is not an obstacle to divinization, but absolutely necessary for it.","|Academic Department:  Theology|Advisor:  Cornille, Catherine",,English,KEEP|REVIEW

The inspiration for this project often came from mathematics in general and from geometry in particular: Just as propositions were ordered in a geometrical demonstration, the argument went, so should propositions be ordered in an overall system of knowledge. Science, it was thought, had to proceed `more geometrico'. I offer a new interpretation of `science emph{more geometrico}' based on an analysis of the explanatory forms used in certain branches of geometry. These branches were optics, astronomy, and mechanics; the so-called subalternate, subordinate, or mixed-mathematical sciences. In Part I, I investigate the nature of the mixed-mathematical sciences according to Aristotle and some `liberal Jesuit' scholastic-Aristotelians. In Part II, the heart of the work, I analyze the metaphysics and physics of Descartes' ""Principles of Philosophy"" (1644, 1647) in light of the findings of Part I and an example from Galileo. I conclude by arguing that we must broaden our understanding of the early modern conception of `science more geometrico' to include concepts taken from the mixed-mathematical sciences. These render the geometrical manner more flexible than previously thought.","|Academic Department:  Philosophy|Advisor:  McGuire, Ted|Machamer, Peter",,English,KEEP|REVIEW

Reality I have defined as an entirety of the physic- and metaphysic reality. A so called panentism where God is reality and the world is a part of this reality.|With Tillich's Systematic Theology as my principal material, I have first made a brief presentation of his theology, of its construction and main concepts. Then I have chosen to further examine the way he describes being, reason and revelation to see how this particular concepts of Tillich agree with my definition of reality. In this I have consulted the books Tillich in Dialogue by Mackenzie-Brown and Natural Theology Versus Theology of Nature, a book edited after the forth international Tillich symposium 1992, which had ""Tillichs thinking as impetus for a discourse among theology, philosophy and natural sciences"" as a theme.|I have tried to point out the possibilities opened up by the ontology and epistemology of Tillich for the dialogue between theology and natural sciences. I have also claimed that his model of being as a unit of physics and metaphysics and his description of the human mind and existential premises, do fit well together with our contemporary scientific descriptions of these territories, thereby suggesting that his theology can function as a bridge between theology and other sciences.|In my examination of the way Tillich see the concept of revelation I have, with the help of Avery Dulles's Models of Revelation, compared him with some other modern theologians and found that his view in emphasizing the symbolic interpretation follows the main theological school of today. Nevertheless I have criticised this view of Tillich because it, in my opinion, to much marginalize the historicity in the biblical stories.","|Academic Department:  Theology and Religious Studies|Advisor:  Hallonsten, Gösta",,Swedish,CULL|REVIEW

This study examines the abilities of school leaders to build communities of inclusion to promote justice in Jesuit high schools, to assess their lived commitment to marginalized students, and to evaluate the effectiveness of leaders in Jesuit high schools as agents of change. By studying two Jesuit high schools with national reputations for being progressive and inclusive, I looked for ways in which Ignatian educators fulfill this mission. Using a case study model, I examined how these communities have developed, the role of the school's leadership, and the formation experience of the faculty. This study focused on the experience of Black, Latino, and LGBT students in Jesuit high schools. While some Jesuit schools are much further along the journey from tolerance to inclusion, there is still an achievement gap between White students and those who are Black or Latino. Similarly, the LGBT community remains marginalized in many Jesuit high schools. This study recommends adult formation and education for school leaders, faculty, and parents in the areas of diversity and inclusion, and a renewed commitment to educating students justly.","|Advisor:  Brown, Carolyn A.",,English,KEEP|REVIEW

Le choix de ce thème a été motivé par le fait que pendant ces dernières années la confrontation avec le pluralisme culturel et religieux a conduit la théologie chrétienne à réfléchir de manière nouvelle sur cette question. Elle porte sur le christianisme en tant qu'il a pour spécificité de rendre témoignage à un homme confessé comme le Fils unique de Dieu et le Sauveur de tous les hommes. Dans ce sens, la finalité de notre recherche est de montrer la signification et la portée de l'affirmation de Jésus-Christ comme unique Médiateur de notre salut, et ce dans le cadre de la théologie fondamentale et en particulier de la christologie. Bien que cette doctrine ait été toujours et soit encore une pierre d'achoppement pour ceux qui ne partagent pas notre foi, elle représente pour la tradition chrétienne plus qu'une croyance centrale, elle est vue comme le fondement même de la foi. Pour montrer la pertinence du sujet traité, ainsi que les chemins à suivre afin de proposer de nouvelles perspectives pour la réflexion théologique, notre point de départ est l'analyse du phénomène de la multiplication des modèles interprétatifs concernant le rapport entre le christianisme et les autres religions. Les recherches menées par Peter Schineller, Joseph Gelot, Paul Knitter, Camil Ménard et Jacques Dupuis dans ce domaine, nous ont permis de nous familiariser avec le vocabulaire utilisé dans la discussion (exclusivisme, inclusivisme, pluralisme, etc.) et de percevoir les possibles relations entre les modèles proposés. Du point de vue de notre travail, ces analyses montrent d'une part que la question christologique se trouve au c?ur du débat, et d'autre part que l'enjeu de celui-ci se situe dans la manière dont les théologiens cités comme représentants de chaque modèle, chacun à partir de ses propres présupposés, traitent la question de l'unicité et de l'universalité du Christ. C'est cette double constatation qui nous a amené à choisir d'étudier la pensée de cinq théologiens contemporains: Karl Barth, Hans Urs von Balthasar, Edward Schillebeeckx, Karl Rahner et John Hick. La partie conclusive de la thèse expose les perspectives christologiques qui se dégagent de la recherche. Elle offre une esquisse élaborée avec la conviction que la christologie ne se limite pas à offrir un répertoire d'opinions sur le Christ, mais qu'elle est une réflexion dynamique et attentive aux défis qui lui sont adressés. Notre étude conduit, d'une part, à une prise de distance critique vis-à-vis des modèles ou catégories qui sont proposés aujourd'hui pour expliquer la pluralité d'opinions concernant l'unicité et l'universalité de Jésus-Christ. Ils ont certainement une pertinence pédagogique, ensemble ils constituent une sorte de carte géographique qui offre des points de repères dans un terrain devenu assez complexe...","|Academic Department:  Theology|Advisor:  Brito y Lanzada, Emilio",,Spanish,CULL|REVIEW

Scholars have identified three main types of students who fall under the category of at-risk students: first-generation students, low-income students, and underrepresented students. The reasons for low college-going rates for at-risk students who are traditional in age vary. Some reasons include insufficient college-knowledge within the family or community, low degree aspirations, lack of social support, and insufficient college readiness. Knowledge about a strong college-going culture for at-risk students is limited. There is a gap in research regarding school cultures which promote college attendance for at-risk students. Many studies focus on the barriers and issues that at-risk students face in the college choice process. However, there is a lack of information regarding a school culture designed to prepare at-risk students for attending college. The purpose of this study is to explore a strong college-going culture designed specifically to prepare traditional-age at-risk students for college. The methodology used for the research is a case study. The site selected for the case study is Cristo Rey Jesuit High School Twin Cities. As part of the methodology, Schein's theory of organizational culture was used. Based on the research, there were three basic underlying assumptions at Cristo Rey; care and love for the individual student, commitment to educating the poor and building student self-esteem and confidence. All the basic underlying assumptions were seen as critical in improving the college-going rates for the at-risk students.","|Academic Department:  Higher Education|Advisor:  Slantcheva-Durst, Snejana",,English,KEEP|REVIEW

F., 1904–1984","The contemporary condition of secularity poses a unique environment in which the Church becomes incarnate in the world. The subject of secularity itself has been the focus of serious academic study, and two broad sources of this phenomenon can be drawn from the lifetime work of Charles Taylor: the rise of foundational epistemology and particular changes within the modern social imaginary. These two paradigm shifts have created a latent moral and religious skepticism within contemporary secular society in which it is generally accepted that complex moral and religious issues cannot be arbitrated by reason and must ultimately be decided on the basis of an individual's personal feeling. In this thesis, the author draws on an integration of studies by Charles Taylor and Bernard Lonergan to establish that intellectual, moral, and religious conversion form the basis for the act of knowing and therefore provide an adequate theological response to the problem of skepticism. Furthermore, the author examines the social imaginary particular to contemporary secular society in order to develop a means by which the Church is able draw on sacramentality, communion, catholicity, the liturgy, and cosmology to embody an incarnational spirituality in a secular age.","|Academic Department:  Theology|Advisor:  Doyle, Dennis",,English,CULL|REVIEW

Instead of being preoccupied with interpretive questions, I examine the logical rigor and precision of Balthasar's arguments, principally in his Theodramatik, in comparison to that found in Maritain, Ratzinger, Lonergan, and other Thomists. I also evaluate the arguments of some who have already criticized his work from one angle or another. Thorough analysis of Balthasar's fundamental claims yields the conclusion that his theological anthropology, in particular, his understanding of the grace-freedom dynamic, is lacking and detrimentally affects his eschatology. His eschatological position that all men may in fact be saved is a result, primarily, of the simplistic view of grace and freedom that he unwittingly assumes. His theology of the descent, while at points rhetorically excessive, represents a legitimate development and does not necessarily entail universalism. Furthermore, while his trinitarian theory at times borders on the mythological (thanks to Adrienne von Speyr), his understanding of divine suffering may be appropriated in dialogue with Jacques Maritain and Joseph Ratzinger, with whom he is closely allied on many fronts. But in order to reclaim Balthasar's theodramatic approach from its tendency toward universalism (following Karl Barth), attention must be given to the twentieth century developments in the Catholic theology of grace, attention which he did not wish to pay to such purportedly ""neo-scholastic"" debates. The growing consensus that has been emerging, at least among Thomists, concerning the question of the divine permission of moral evil, fills a lacuna in Balthasar's project, derailing it from the path of universalism and setting it on track toward a more robust theological anthropology. A critique of his monumental work along these lines yields a more balanced approach to the task of reconciling God's infinite mercy with the persistent reality of moral evil. The unbounded power of God's grace is not undermined by recognizing the possibility of created freedom to refuse His glory definitively; rather, the natural integrity of human freedom is slighted by an over-emphatic anti-Pelagian view of grace as either inherently irresistible or predetermined to be impotent. The intrinsic efficacy of divine grace and the natural integrity of human freedom together must be affirmed. The eschatological consequence of such a moderate view is precisely a more modest proposal for how in the end God may be ""omnia in omnibus"" (1 Cor 15:28).","|Advisor:  Root, Michael",,English,CULL|REVIEW

Si le poète est de culture jésuite, le recueil, cependant, atteste en poésie une veine augustinienne en dehors de Port-Royal, liée au milieu spirituel normand de l'époque et à l'influence des oratoriens augustiniens. Brébeuf, réussit une double synthèse. Il parvient à faire coïncider dans la poétique de la méditation une grande partie du protocole et des processus mentaux issus de la spiritualité jésuite avec un fonds augustinien austère et pessimiste, puisé à la fois à la source des Confessions et dans la tradition augustinienne. Brébeuf réussit, par ailleurs, à concilier les principes d'une esthétique mondaine avec la dénonciation des vanités du monde et la volonté de conduire son lecteur, à travers une instance d'énonciation fluctuante et labile, à la pénitence et à la conversion. Les Entretiens solitaires s'affichent comme une vanité littéraire dont les stratégies rhétoriques sont destinées à toucher le lecteur et à faire céder le bastion de son amour-propre pour creuser en lui une capacité susceptible d'être habitée par la grâce de Dieu. Le recueil des Entretiens solitaires, entre baroque et classicisme, aura été l'occasion d'un divertissement pieux qui, en alternant les chants de la Grâce et du Néant, prépare un horizon de conversion, dans un au-delà du texte insaisissable.||Famous in the 1650s, for his gallant and heroic verses, the poet native from Normandy, Georges de Brébeuf, publishes the Solitary Conversations or the Prayers and the meditations in verse French in 1660. Although he belongs to the Jesuit culture, the Solitary Conversations attest in poetry an augustinian vein out of Port-Royal poetry, due to the influence of the Norman spiritual environment and the preponderant part of augustinian oratorians. Brébeuf succeeded in a double synthesis. He made coincide, in the poetics of meditation, a large part of the protocol and the mental processes of Jesuit spirituality with an austere and pessimistic augustinian content, drawn both from the Confessions of Augustine and the augustinian tradition. Moreover, Brébeuf managed to reconcile the principles of worldly aesthetics, with the denunciation of vanities of the world and the will to lead his reader, through a fluctuating and unstable subject of enunciation, to penance and conversion. The Solitary Conversations can really be considered as a literary Vanity which uses some rhetorical strategies to move the reader and to break the bastion of his self-esteem. Once the intimate space became empty of sinner's ""ego"", the divine Grace can fill back this pure capacity. The Solitary Conversations, between baroque and classicism, may have been, for the readers, the occasion of a pious entertainment and, by alternating the songs of the Grace and the Nothingness, may have prepared their conversion, beyond the text. But that rests on a Mystery of God.","2 vols.: Le vol. 1 contient une introduction et le vol. 2 le texte de l'oeuvre.|Academic Department:  French Language and Literature|Advisor:  Landry, Jean-Pierre",,French,CULL|REVIEW

It is widely observed that believers experience a disconnect between their lives of prayer and worship on the one hand and their workaday lives on the other. Drawing upon the work of philosopher Martin Heidegger, historian Georges Duby, and anthropologist Marcel Mauss, Chauvet constructs a model of Christian existence with sacramentality at its very core---a model which takes full account of the fruitful tension that exists between sacramental worship and daily life. I begin by examining past efforts to grasp the nature of the relationship between sacrament and ethics, including what Vatican Council II brings to the question. Theologians such as Karl Rahner, Edward Schillebeeckx, Bernard Häring, Juan Luis Segundo, Vigen Guroian, Don Saliers, and Virgil Michel all addressed this issue, but like the Council itself, none of these figures examined how sacramental ritual as ritual implicated participants in the living of an ethical life. Subsequent chapters investigate how Chauvet has used post-modern linguistic theory associated with Heidegger and the gift theory associated with Mauss in order to provide a framework for understanding how sacramental ritual inaugurates or re-inaugurates the Christian identity of those who participate in them and also how these rituals of their very nature involve a return-gift to God of loving praxis towards one's neighbors. Aspects of Chauvet's program have been challenged by Henry Mottu, Yves Labbé, Jean-Yves Quellec, Vincent Miller, and Daniel Franklin Pilario. These writers question Chauvet's appropriation of Heidegger and Chauvet's use of anthropological categories. I argue that Chauvet's thought can on the whole be vindicated against these critics. The dissertation concludes by placing Chauvet in dialogue with liberation theologians such as Jon Sobrino and with feminist theologians such as Susan Ross in order to examine how Chauvet's thought can be brought to bear on the concerns such thinkers bring to the table; I also analyze Sunday celebrations in the absence of a priest from the perspective of Chauvet's theology.","|Academic Department:  Theology|Advisor:  Laurance, John",,English,CULL|REVIEW

Among some political theorists and historians, there is a continuing debate surrounding the origins and nature of liberal democracy. Some place Suarez in a line of thought which has its foundations in the medieval jurists and later scholastic theologians and which is then developed by the more modern thinkers, such as Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau, while others see the modern thinkers as departing from Suarez. In addition, most commentators ignore or give little attention to key areas of his work pertaining to church/state relations and subjective natural rights and natural law---both of which are important factors in assessing his relationship to liberal democracy. Although Suarez writes of a ""state of nature,"" two ""social contracts,"" political power and popular sovereignty, and subjective natural rights and law, he has a specific qualified understanding of these notions which are rooted in his overall hierarchical view of God and nature, and the political and ecclesial powers and communities. Consequently, whatever he claims regarding the naturalness and ""independence"" and ""autonomy"" of the political order, he does not retreat from the supernatural and spiritual order. The connection between these two orders manifests itself most especially in the relation between the political power and the spiritual power of the Church under the rubric of the indirect power of the pope in temporal matters. Suarez distinguishes between the non-Christian king and kingdom and the Christian king and kingdom, resulting in two different relations between the two powers. Furthermore, Suarez does claim that there are subjective natural rights that have their ultimate foundation in the fact that man is made in the image of God, and is master of himself. These rights are understood in connection with man's social nature, whereby man lives in community with others in order that he might reach the end for which he was created. Laws are a primary means to lead man to this end. Thus, any natural rights that one possesses are always conditioned by these laws, especially the natural moral law which gives rights their purposeful direction.","|Academic Department:  Theology|Advisor:  Walsh, David",,English,CULL|REVIEW

Within Tupi villages, colonial missions and European courts, these ritual vestments played a key role in the creation of a pan-Atlantic colonial interculture. Produced from feathers of the scarlet ibis, these capes played an important role in Tupi corporeality and community. My dissertation attends to the physical qualities of the extant capes and examines the discourses that early modern chroniclers and modern anthropologists constructed around them. Letters by Jesuit missionaries in Brazil surprisingly reveal the continued manufacture and use of Tupi feathered capes within the aldeia (mission) system in both indigenous and Christian rituals. Jesuit missionaries also shipped the capes to Europe, where with other artifacts they extended the conceptual space of colonialism to the Old World. They traveled along social, mercantile and political networks, and entered scholarly and princely collections, where they were studied for their technical mastery and redeployed within court pageantry. ""Brazil"" and the ""Tupinamba"" were concepts mediated by missionaries, merchants, slaves and indigenes in the spatial realms of ports, plantations, missions, marketplaces and courts. The financial incentives of the brazilwood and sugar industries drove European involvement with Brazilian peoples and coastal forests. The Tupi and their plumed artifacts traveled alongside these exported commodities, tangible indices of European economic interests in the New World. By constructing a socio-cultural ""biography"" of the Tupi feathered capes, I trace their changing functions and value as they move from place to place. As ritual vestments, they contributed to the social coding within and among Tupi kinship groups and colonial intermediaries, including early modern merchants, scholars and princes. A reification of the process of social construction, the capes were instrumental in the performance of identity and agency in the colonial nexus. By examining the intersection of these objects with a series of early modern places, people, and institutions I contribute to our knowledge of colonial indigenous traditions within Brazil and of the institutional and economic basis of European engagement with the New World.",,,English,KEEP|REVIEW
Dissertation,"Burke, James B.",2007,Crafting a Global Just Peacebuilding Ethic from Just War Theory and Strategic Nonviolent Conflict,Chicago,Loyola University Chicago,224,PhD diss.,,,,,20th century,Political Thought -- Pacifism|Philosophy -- Ethics|Controversies -- War,,"Murray, John Courtney, 1904–1967","Christian ethics' conflation of nonviolence with pacifism makes late twentieth century attempts to integrate nonviolence into Roman Catholic ethics incoherent. This dissertation proposes a corrective to this conflation: To become the critical component of a public Roman Catholic global just peacebuilding ethic, nonviolence must be understood as distinct from pacifism, as integral to as well as transformative of just-war tradition, and as unifying just war theory and pacifism coherently within Catholic social teaching. The author argues this thesis in four steps. One, Reinhold Niebuhr forged theological ethics' conflation of nonviolence with pacifism through his Christian realist polemics against fellow liberal Protestant Christian pacifists in the 1930s. That conflation migrated into Catholic ethics in the 1950s by way of Protestant ethicist Paul Ramsey and Jesuit John Courtney Murray's shared aim of reclaiming just war theory for the nuclear age. Since 1950, political scientist Gene Sharp's research into nonviolence flatly contradicts Christian ethics' conflation of nonviolence with pacifism. Two, the U.S. Catholic bishops' peace pastoral (1983) and tenth anniversary statement compound the inherited conflation and fail to differentiate nonviolence from pacifism even after witnessing the 1989 nonviolent revolutions.

Four, using Sharp's theory of political power to differentiate nonviolence as force from pacifism, the author claims Christian ethics must evaluate strategic nonviolent conflict force with just-war criteria.

They can be identified in seminal form with specific New Testament passages. The St. Stephen model shows the strength of Christian witness to lead others to Christ, and is based on the martyrdom of St. Stephen (Acts 7:54–-60). The Jerusalem model describes the evangelizing power of the sacred liturgy, and is discerned in the first Christian liturgical celebrations in Jerusalem (Acts 2:42–-47). The Petrine model points to the preaching of the Word, and has its origin in St. Peter's first sermon on the day of Pentecost (Acts 2:14–-41). The Apostolic model highlights the role of the small, fervent community in the propagation of the faith, and is founded on Jesus' selection and commissioning of the Twelve Apostles (Mk 3:13–-19). The Areopagus model involves the inculturation of Christianity in the fabric of society, and looks to St. Paul's address to the Athenians in the Areopagus as its prototype (Acts 17:16–-34). The Loaves and Fishes model calls attention to the evangelizing effects of Christian charity reflected in the corporal and spiritual works of mercy performed by His followers, and is typified in Jesus' healing and feeding the multitudes (Mt 15:29–-38). Each of these models of evangelization is readily observed in every age of Church history. In the American context, the St. Stephen model is illustrated in the courageous Jesuit witness before the native peoples of North America. The Jerusalem model was extensively employed by Junipero Serra and his fellow Franciscans as a primary means of introducing the California Indians to the mystery of Christ. The Petrine model is portrayed in the parish mission crusade that revived the immigrant Church in the nineteenth century. The Apostolic model is represented by the mission of Fr. Hecker and the Paulist Fathers, the first religious order of priests founded in America. The Areopagus model is evident in the life a ...",|Academic Department:  Theology,,English,KEEP|REVIEW

Les vastes espaces septentrionaux se consolidèrent alors comme des régions de frontière: les plus lointaines étaient à peine explorées, celles situées plus près des centres de colonisation furent progressivement, mais de manière précaire, intégrées à la monarchie. Au cours du siècle, les missionnaires, notamment franciscains et jésuites, jouèrent un rôle très actif dans le processus d’appropriation de ces marges: en tant qu’explorateurs, évangélisateurs et colonisateurs au service du roi, ils s’insérèrent graduellement dans les espaces du septentrion. Tout d’abord, il fut nécessaire d’imaginer les contrées qui restaient inconnues – la Californie, le Nouveau Mexique: à partir d’une amalgame de mythes et de savoirs à la double origine, européenne et indienne, les religieux dressèrent des cartes et des rapports représentant ces régions convoitées. Avec le passage du temps, la composante américaine desdites représentations s’accentua. Parallèlement, pendant le processus d'incorporation de la Nouvelle-Biscaye, la Compagnie de Jésus y articula un réseau de missions afin de christianiser-« civiliser » les populations et d’occuper les territoires toujours réfractaires à la conquête. Les religieux durent ainsi adapter leurs stratégies d’appropriation aux caractéristiques de l’espace. Enfin, les frontières du Nord génèrent des conditions de vie difficiles pour les missionnaires qui furent parfois découragés de leur travail et conduits vers des comportements peu orthodoxes du point de vue religieux.| |In the XVIIth century, the conquering advance of Spaniards was met by resistance from territories and men in the north of New Spain. The vast septentrional reaches were then consolidated as frontier regions, as the most remote areas were barely explored, while regions located closer to settlement centers were progressively, yet precariously, integrated to monarchy. In the course of the century, missionaries, especially Franciscans and Jesuits, played a very active role in the appropriation process of border regions. As explorers, evangelists and colonizers for the King of Spain, they gradually settled in the septentrional regions. At first, it was necessary to imagine unknown reaches: California, New Mexico. Picking from a set of myths and knowledge with a dual – European and Native American – origin, the priests drew up maps and reports of the coveted areas. As time passed, representations showed increased American influence. In parallel, as integration of New Biscay progressed, the Company of Jesus articulated a network of missions with the objective to christianize – “civilize” – populations and occupy the territories that resisted conquest. The missionaries had to adapt their appropriation strategies to land characteristics. Finally, missionaries had to face difficult life conditions at the northern frontiers, and were at times disheartened in their work and lapsed into rather unorthodox behaviors from a religious point of view.","|Academic Department:  History|Advisor:  Ragon, Pierre",,French,CULL|REVIEW

Utilizando o que se denomina método comparativo direto entre princípios que constituem as artes da palavra, no caso a oratória religiosa e a representação teatral, chegou-se até os escritos dos Exercícios Espirituais de Inácio de Loyola que em suas propostas estabelecem recursos que eram usados como instrumento no desenvolvimento da arte da oratória jesuítica. Com o apoio da tese de Mario Iannaccone, chegou-se ao importante texto do cineasta Sergei Einseinstein, Teoria geral da Montagem, que nos ajudou a compreender como tais princípios dos Exercícios Espirituais de Inácio de Loyola também se encontram presentes na arte do teatrólogo russo do século XX. Reconhecendo a importância da elaboração da palavra nestas artes, da oratória e da interpretação teatral, e percebendo que tal palavra se propõe em ambos os casos a uma transformação psíquica de seus ouvintes, respectivamente a conversão nos sermões e a catarse no teatro, verificou-se como tal palavra deve ser elaborada a partir dos princípios que esses autores propõem. Para tanto, foin estudado em Marina Massimi as concepções dos dinamismos psíquicos que fundamentam os autores jesuítas em suas propostas de construção da palavra para suas pregações. Inspirados em Margarida Vieira Mendes, especialista em Antonio Vieira, foram recortados alguns itens que ela indica como constitutivos do Sermão da Sexagésima e foi estabelecido um breve roteiro que ajudou a compreender de forma direta as semelhanças que serão verificadas quanto às artes da oratória nos pregadores dos séculos XVI e XVII e do teatro em Constantin Stanislavski. Por fim, analisando os dados obtidos, chegou-se a algumas conclusões destas semelhanças quanto a paralelos de raízes filosóficas e quanto à compreensão dos dinamismos psíquicos humanos, percebendo o porquê de tais práticas conseguirem atingir e transformar o psiquismo de suas audiências.||Having found in the words of Antonio Vieiras Sermon of the Sixtieth (Vieira: 1608–1697) the proposed principles for the art of lecture which are also seen in the writings of Constantin Stanislavski (1863–1938) for the art of acting, this work goes on to check where the basis that lay the foundation for such principles in Antonio Vieira lie and whether such bases are somehow related to the theatrical works performed by Constantin Stanislavski. Using what we call direct comparative method among the principles which make up the arts of words in this case the religious lecturing and the theatrical representation we came to the writings of the Spiritual Exercising from Inácio de Loyola, which establish in its proposals the resources used as tools in the development of the Jesuitical lecturing art. With the support of Mario Iannaccones thesis, we came to the outstanding excerpt from the filmmaker Sergei Einsenstein General Theory of the Montage, which helped us understand how such principles of Spiritual Exercising from Inácio de Loyola are also present in the art of the 20th century Russian playwright. Recognizing the importance of word elaboration in such arts lecturing and theatric performance and realizing that such a word aims, in both cases, at a psychological transformation of its hearer, respectively the conversion through the sermons and the catharsis in the theatre, we checked how such word is supposed to be elaborated from the principles proposed by these two authors. To do so, we studied in Marina Massimi the conceptions of the psychiatric dynamisms which serve as a basis for the Jesuit authors in their proposals of word construction in their lectures. Inspired in Margarida Vieira Mendes, who is an expert in Antonio Vieira, some items were transcript to indicate as belonging to the Sermon of the Sixtieth and a brief script to help understand in a direct way the similarities to be investigated regarding the lecturing arts of the 16th and 17th century preachers and the theatre in Constantin Stanislavski. Finally, by analyzing the data obtained, we came to some conclusions about these similarities as for the parallels of the philosophic roots and for the understanding of the human psychic dynamisms, realizing why such practices are able to achieve and transform audiences psyches.","|Academic Department:  Faculdade de Filosofia, Ciências e Letras de Ribeirão Preto|Advisor:  Marina Massimi",,Portuguese,CULL|REVIEW

Founded in the year 1540 by Ignatius of Loyola, the Jesuits sponsor 28 colleges and universities in the United States. Jesuit institutions have reputations for academic excellence marked by rigor and mission-centric values. This dissertation's primary research questions examine the relationship between institutional religious affiliation and undergraduates' Jesuit values, deep learning, and student engagement. Secondary research questions examine the extent to which Jesuit institutions' leaders report intentionality in having undergraduates' employ Jesuit values in their daily lives as well as assessment practices being used. Descriptive and multivariate analyses of data from more than 18,000 student respondents to the National Survey of Student Engagement (NSSE) are used to examine the primary research questions. Secondary research questions are addressed analyzing data from a questionnaire completed by senior administrators at the nation's Jesuit postsecondary institutions.

In the Pampas, the Spaniards did not encounter large, farming Indian populations like those of central Mexico or the Andean highlands, but mobile hunter-gatherers whom they were unable to conquer and subdue. Using an ethnohistorical approach, this dissertation shows that although Indians remained independent, they thoroughly reinvented their societies under the multidimensional impact of the Spanish arrival, which included ecological changes, epidemics, slaving raids, and intercultural commerce. Most dramatically, the Pampa Indians became superb horse-riders, deft hunters of (feral) cattle, avid consumers of Spanish manufactures, and an integral part of long-distance exchange networks that extended west across the Andes and reached into southern Chile. On the basis of this ethnohistorical understanding of the Pampas, this dissertation offers an ambitious reconsideration of Buenos Aires' early colonial period. The intersection of Andean and Atlantic trade circuits in Buenos Aires during the seventeenth century provided the stimuli for the development of cattle ranching as a main local economic activity. Spanish settlers adapted Iberian cattle-ranching practices to the challenges and opportunities of the Pampas by developing a hunting industry to exploit the proliferating herds of feral livestock that roamed the plains. Such hunting industry put the Spaniards in direct contact, and competition, with the Indians who inhabited the Pampas and with the Indians who arrived seasonally from the Andean zone to hunt and trade. The dissertation examines the complex intercultural and intertribal relations that ensued, which included Indian raids, military expeditions, diplomatic negotiations and treaties, and short-lived Jesuit missions. By the 1750s, these relations had resulted in the emergence of a militarized frontier line lying barely a hundred miles southwest of Buenos Aires. This frontier line defined intercultural relations in the Pampas for the next hundred years, and became a fundamental element in the narrative of Argentina's emergence as a modern nation in the early twentieth century.","|Academic Department:  History|Advisor:  Baily, Samuel",,English,KEEP|REVIEW

During these years the colony served as a haven for hundreds of thousands who were fleeing Japanese expansion. A central aspect of Macau's war experience was the internal life of the colony. However, little or no published or archival material is available on this subject. Accordingly, the only feasible way to study this aspect of the territory's history is to draw on the testimony of those who in fact did experience wartime conditions in Macau. For the interview process, subjects were selected who belong to a distinct ethno-cultural group that has emerged from Macau's Portuguese and Chinese heritages - the Macanese. Besides the Macanese community resident in Macau, there are also several diasporic communities around the world. Many members of these communities spent the duration of the war in Macau as refugees, and the interview process clearly showed that members of the diasporic and resident Macanese communities had qualitatively different memories of the Second World War. Furthermore, the recollections of the Portuguese Jesuit priest Father Manuel Teixeira have played a prominent if idiosyncratic role in perceptions of Macau's Second World War experience, and so his testimony is discussed in relation to that of the Macanese. The way in which those interviewed expressed their perceptions of the past seemed to be rooted in and shaped by their experiences both before and since the war. Memory is, in other words, a construct. By analysing these narrated memories in terms of the existing theoretical literature on oral history and collective memory, this thesis strives to shed light on the connections between experience, memory, and the construction of the Second World War in the resident and diasporic Macanese communities.",|Academic Department:  History,,English,KEEP|REVIEW

Most scholars have considered sign-language, pantomime, and other nonverbal means of communication (visual, sonorous, tactile, etc.), as temporary, imperfect, and insignificant solutions to the lack of mutual linguistic understanding during early colonial encounters. It is also often assumed that these means of communication, combined with seemingly insurmountable cultural differences, inevitably promoted misunderstandings, incomprehension, and violent conflicts between early colonists and native populations. Seeking to challenge these assumptions, this work closely analyzes the nature, origins, change over time, and cultural implications of nonverbal and paralinguistic forms of communication, which I argue importantly contributed to the accommodation process and the emergence of cultural hybridity in the early French-Indian Atlantic. This dissertation offers to expand and refine our understanding of cross-cultural communication and miscommunication in various colonial settings. To do so, it brings in a comparative perspective the experiences of a wide range of French explorers, missionaries, colonial officials, mariners, soldiers, and settlers with a variety of native peoples, cultures, and societies in Brazil, Florida, the Caribbean, Canada, and the Upper Mississippi Valley, from 1500 to the conclusion of the Great Peace of Montreal in 1701. Research for this project was conducted in both published and archival sources, using the original French language versions of the sources, for which I provide new or first translations. The comparative scope of this work brings into question the predominant Canadian-centered chronology that has lead past studies of French America, and seeks to put grater emphasis on the influence that local indigenous cultures and contexts had on colonial developments and in shaping the alliance. Through five thematic/chronological chapters, my work traces the emergence of a culturally-syncretic repertoire for communication in the early French Atlantic, in which non-linguistic elements were at least as important as spoken words to mediate relations between individuals and groups. Starting with the emergence of shared nonverbal codes during first contacts, the project then explores the process of acculturation as a sensory journey through otherness, then demonstrates the permanence of nonverbal means of communication during and after the mutual acquisition of language by French and Indians. It provides an in-depth look at the role of nonverbal performances in ceremonial oratory in seventeenth-century New France with particular attention to the contest between Jesuit and Indian orators. The dissertation ends with a comparison of nonverbal dimensions of diplomacy in New France and the Caribbean, until the eve of the eighteenth century.",|Academic Department:  History,,English,KEEP|REVIEW

Sie möchte untersuchen, wie Karl Rahner (1904–1984), einer der einflussreichsten katholischen Theologen des 20. Jahrhunderts und ein Mann der offenen Augen, dieses Problem in seinen Schriften behandelt.|Das Theodizee-Thema entzieht sich bei Rahner in den meisten Fällen und wurde deshalb in der Sekundärliteratur bislang allenfalls am Rande gestreift, jedoch nicht ausführlich – mit Bezug auf einschlägige Textstellen – behandelt. Auch nach den Gründen, warum Rahner sich kaum dazu geäußert hat, wurde noch nicht eingehender gefragt. Diese Lücke möchte die Arbeit schließen.|Um einen Zugang zu Rahners Werk zu finden, wurde eine Stichwortsuche durchgeführt und die gefundenen Textstellen auf ihre Relevanz hin analysiert. Zunächst wurde dabei in allgemeiner Form nach der Theodizee-Thematik gefragt. Im zweiten Schritt wurde der Tatsache Rechnung getragen, dass Rahner seine Schriften zum großen Teil „nach Auschwitz“ verfasst hat, als sich die Theodizeefrage in verschärfter Form neu stellte. In besonderer Weise wurde Rahners Aufsatz „Warum läßt uns Gott leiden?“ berücksichtigt.|Es fällt auf, dass Rahner insbesondere das Problem des Bösen beschäftigt. Wenn er auch die Rückfrage an Gott offenhält, wehrt er sich doch im Sinne Augustins und in Frontstellung gegenüber Tendenzen seiner Zeit, das Phänomen der Schuld zu unterschlagen, dagegen, den Menschen aus der Verantwortung zu entlassen. Tendenziell ist eine Reduktion der Frage auf eine Theodizee des je eigenen Todes zu beobachten, was Rahners transzendentaltheologischem Ansatz geschuldet sein dürfte. Danach ist der Mensch grundsätzlich dazu aufgefordert, sich dem unbegreiflichen Geheimnis seines Daseins anzuvertrauen. Insofern hat Theodizee nichtbegreifend, in Glaube, Hoffnung und Liebe zu geschehen. Auschwitz bedeutet nach Rahner eine fundamentale Erschütterung des Gottesglaubens, der aber – gerade im Blick auf die Opfer der Geschichte – ein Gebot der Nächstenliebe bleibt, bietet er doch eine Perspektive der Hoffnung.||This thesis deals with the question of God that is central to theology, more particularly with the vital question of God and human suffering. Its purpose is to analyze the way in which Karl Rahner (1904–1984), one of the most influential theologians of the 20th century and a man with eyes wide open on things, treats this problem in his writing.|In Rahner the topic of theodicy is difficult to grasp in most cases and has therefore been dealt with – if at all – in a marginal way in secondary literature; but it has never been treated in any depth and with direct reference to pertinent text passages. Furthermore, the reasons why Rahner hardly ever dealt with the subject explicitly have not yet been focused on. This thesis means to close this gap.|In order to approach Rahner’s work a keyword search has been made and the references found have been analyzed with regard to their relevance. During a first approach the question of the theodicy topic was asked more generally. In a second step it was taken into account that Rahner wrote most of his works “after Auschwitz” when the question of theodicy was put anew and more poignantly. Particular consideration was given to Rahner’s essay “Why does God allow us to suffer?”.|Obviously the problem of evil is his main concern. Even though he admits the reproachful question to God, he follows Augustine and is in opposition to tendencies of his time that reject the phenomenon of guilt, when he refuses to relieve man from personal responsibility. There seems to be a tendency to reduce the question to a theodicy of individual death; this may be due to Rahner’s transcendental-theological approach. According to this approach man is principally asked to have confidence in the incomprehensible mystery of his existence. Insofar theodicy has to come about – non-comprehendingly – in faith, hope and love.|As to Rahner, Auschwitz marks a fundamental challenge to the belief in God, which remains however – especially with regard to the victims of history – a commandment of brotherly love, offering a perspective of hope.","Institut für Systematische Theologie|Academic Department:  Theology|Advisor:  Walter, Peter",,German,CULL|REVIEW

Revising existing interpretations, it argues that both clerical and lay Catholics, chief among them the printer Mathew Carey, carefully negotiated the first Catholic presence in the public sphere through the medium of print. This early Catholic culture appropriated ""enlightened"" rhetoric and modes of expression in order to critique the anti-Catholic legacy of the Colonial period that viewed Catholicism as a remnant of the ""Dark Ages"" and incompatible with republicanism. I argue that this pervasive historical view of Catholicism as anti-progressive is key to understanding the persistence of anti-Catholicism in the history-conscious early republic. Catholics of this era strove to define the public face of the Church in America as sympathetic to the dominant values of the founding generation, and to dispute Whig historical views of Catholicism's role in history, especially the history of England and then Britain. In this era, I argue, anti-Catholicism can be viewed as primarily ideological in nature.; Mathew Carey's brand of republican Catholicism brought from Ireland in the 1780s provided an existing model for this experiment, and like-minded American-born Catholics such as first bishop John Carroll also attempted to carefully control perceptions of the new church as ""foreign."" This was achieved through printed statements addressed to American Catholics, to President Washington, in responses to renegade or outspoken Catholic clergy, through Catholic devotional and instructional publications, the printing and marketing of the first Douai Bible in America, critiques of Whig history, and in Carey's participation in an extended newspaper controversy sparked by a derogatory reference to Catholic doctrine made by a politician.; By the time of Carey's death in 1839, this experiment in enlightened, republican Catholicism ended, as the Church, facing renewed anti-Catholicism that arose in reaction to massive ethnic Catholic immigration, ghettoized itself into an enclosed sub-culture increasingly viewed as dominated by ""foreign"" clerical leadership.","|Academic Department:  History|Advisor:  Shammas, Carole",,English,CULL|REVIEW

Thus, by concentrating on missionary live cycles, more specific historical aspects of apostolic work are investigated. Three sets of questions about evangelical action in its relation to colonization are also raised: the conquest of the Indians, the missionary village’s degree of autonomy or dependence in relation to the laic world, and the political and cultural role of the missions in the establishment of a territorial frontier. Finally, the discourses about the Indians and the pastoral practices are studied.","|Academic Department:  Hispanic and Latino-American Languages|Advisor:  Lavallé, Bernard",,French,CULL|REVIEW

F., 1904–1984","This dissertation is a comparative study of spiritual cultivation in Early Daoism and the spiritual teaching of Augustine's Christianity. My goal is to examine how early Daoism's founder, Laozi, and the Christian bishop, Augustine of Hippo, characterize the fulfillment of humanity through religious transformation. My argument is that the metaphysical speculations that figure in their works---and which scholarly readers often emphasize---are offshoots of profound practical, soteriological concerns. These soteriological concerns reveal that the primary interest for both writers was to discover those spiritual and intellectual practices that could most effectively mediate between human experience and the manifestation of transcendent order. This study takes its inspiration from pioneering instances of comparative theology (particularly works by Francis Clooney S.J. and Lee Yearly), and focuses on the cross-reading of texts. For Laozi, the basic text used in this study is. For Augustine, the primary text is de Trinitate, with some Daode Jing closely related writings. Both texts play similar formative roles in their respective religious traditions. My methodology also makes heuristic use of Bernard Lonergan's study of the fourfold operation of human consciousness as experience, understanding, judgment and decision. This general description of human consciousness is a useful framework to draw out similarities and differences in these texts. The primary thematic interest of the thesis is ethical. I explore how early Daoism and Augustine's Christianity were both animated by the concern to confront human violence through spiritual exercises and the renewal of authentic humanity. In comparing Daode Jing and de Triniate, I consider the ways that each author's encounter with social violence shaped their intellectual projects. Laozi and Augustine's search for transcendent order was motivated by the hope of overcoming disordered human desires. This task required an understanding of human participation in transcendent order which could be realized in direct realms of experience, through knowledge of the operations of interior consciousness and the practice of daily spiritual exercises. Though both thinkers are often treated in dogmatic or philosophical terms, their primary interest was in practical spirituality, a way of living. Both Laozi and Augustine searched for `the Way"" for disciples of their respective traditions to nurture personal life and to maintain hope as a religious community in a turbulent world. These issues are dealt with in four chapters. In Chapter One I develop my theoretical framework and the categories of the hermeneutics of consciousness. In Chapter Two I reconstruct the political-religious context of Chinese culture that the author of Daode Jing criticized . Against this context, I then explain in Chapter Three Laozi's major insights into the nature of transcendent order, particularly his understanding of its character as Three in One (Self-so, Nothing and Something), specified in Daode Jing. In Chapter Four I expound Augustine's development of the doctrine of the Trinity as the fundamental signature of divine reality, which is also reflected in the structure of human subjectivity. This leads to Chapter Five where I consider these two views as dialogical partners and advance the view that a juxtapositional reading of these two texts leads to new insights through the way that each can be said to develop a distinctive interpretation of the concept ""effortless action.","|Academic Department:  Theology|Advisor:  Heim, Mark S.",,English,CULL|REVIEW

Thinking highly of knowledge is also the important cultural aspect of the western civilization. Not only the Macartney embassy in 1793 is a good case for researching this kind of phenomenon, but also an alternative new perspective to reconsider the Chinese modern history. Compared with the western embassy before, the Macartney embassy possessed the character of scientific investigation team and the specific characteristic of intentionally showing the English civilization (technology and industry) in the character of present as well. The embassy purposely brought quite a few advanced instruments and weapons as presents, including the newest industrial manufactures, mechanical models and scientific instruments and so on (the total sum is 29). There are even novel technological devices, such as hot balloon and diving bell, in order to manifest the priority of its material civilization. However, the main purpose of displaying presents is not for transmitting scientific gospel, so blaming the emperor Qiang-long for not grasping the opportunity of modernization, so called modernization discourse, is not reasonable. Collecting all kinds of Chinese technical information, such as paktong, nankeen, and tea-producing, by means of scientific investigation, the embassy had certain impacted on the lost of the world market advantage of the Chinese manufactures afterwards. Besides the embassys observation on every aspects of the Chinese society is apparently different from the Chinese image provided by the Jesuits, so it recast and rewrote the good impressions and fancies of western society on Chinese and ended the chinoiserie of the west at last. Although the embassy failed to achieve the goal of the diplomatic mission, they brought the new viewpoint of China to the west: from The Middle Kingdom to The Muddle Kingdom, which its entire civilization lapsed into the state","|Academic Department:  History|Advisor:  Huang, Y-Long, [黃一農]",,Chinese,CULL|REVIEW

Il s'agit de voir comment et pour quelles raisons les femmes, et en particulier leur corps, sont l'objet d'une disciplinarisation sociale qui abouti à une redéfinition et à une codification précise de la féminité à partir de la Réforme et de la confessionnalisation des sociétés.

This thesis focuses on normative books written by theologians, Protestant ministers and Jesuits, dealing with diverse subjects like education, marriage, maternity and widowhood. Laws and decrees about daily life have also been analysed, just like medical treaties revealing the mechanisms of the female body discipline in an interconfessional perspective. It shows how gestures, attitudes, appearance, sexuality and language were controlled in order to define a specific habitus. Beside the norms spread in the different documents under scrutiny, some practices related to the female body have been studied from letters, memoirs and statements of offence.

Le régime en place est alors celui du gouvernement de Chiang Kai-shek et notre étude se propose d’explorer l’implantation des Jésuites sur l’île sous le régime de Chiang Kai-shek. La problématique s’organise principalement autour de deux thèmes. Le premier concerne le contexte dans lequel s’intègrent les Jésuites: quelle est l’influence sur la mission jésuite du contexte politique que connaît alors Taiwan? Comment les autorités tentent-elles d’exercer leur influence sur les Jésuites et l’Eglise taiwanaise? Quelles sont les caractéristiques des relations que tissent les Jésuites avec le pouvoir politique? La politique nationale suprême de la contre-offensive sur le continent et de l’anti-communisme a-t-elle un impact sur la mission jésuite? Quels sont les effets de l’idéologique politique du Guomindang sur l’action des Jésuites? Le deuxième thème est centré sur les initiatives mêmes des Jésuites: les démarches pour implanter l’Eglise, les raisons de leurs succès ou de leurs échecs, les obstacles rencontrés dans leurs missions et enfin, leurs rapports avec la société taiwanaise. Cette étude nous conduira à explorer la mutation que connaît l’entreprise missionnaire menée par les Jésuites, depuis son avènement jusqu’à son déclin. Le sujet est vaste mais notre ambition n’est pas de découvrir toutes les raisons expliquant l’essor et le déclin de la mission jésuite à Taiwan. Nous nous focaliserons sur celles relatives à l’action du gouvernement et au contexte social. L’essor économique que connaît Taiwan sous Chiang Kai-shek a une grande influence sur la vie de l’Eglise taiwanaise, de même que le changement de la vie familiale et des mentalités. Nous nous limiterons à l’étude des facteurs de changement ayant trait à la mission jésuite, tels que l’émigration des habitants et la mutation de la société à travers l’éducation et le travail. Nous porterons une attention particulière à la manière dont les Jésuites appréhendent la culture locale, pour adapter aux indigènes la doctrine catholique. Pour mieux comprendre les caractéristiques de la mission jésuite, nous chercherons notamment à montrer en quoi les Jésuites évoluent de l’“adaptation” à l’“inculturation”. Nous tenterons, à partir des notions d’inculturation et d’adaptation, d’analyser la rencontre entre la doctrine catholique présentée par les Jésuites et la vie du peuple taiwanais; nous montrerons également les réactions des Jésuites face aux problèmes rencontrés: la gestion des œuvres missionnaires, la pédagogie jésuite et l’approche du peuple en sont autant de facettes. La question de l’inculturation est centrale dans notre étude. Bien que la théorie de l’inculturation se constitue à partir des années 1980, notre étude s’enrichira à la lumière de cette théorie, y compris pour explorer les missions jésuites en Chine du temps de Matteo Ricci et également pour analyser l’action jésuite à Taiwan dans la deuxième moitié du XXe siècle. Afin de mieux comprendre les caractéristiques des missions jésuites à Taiwan, nous insisterons en premier lieu, dans la structure de notre étude, sur l’origine des Jésuites de Taiwan, leurs rapports avec les autorités ecclésiales taiwanaises, avec le gouvernement taiwanais et avec la Curie Généralice de Rome. En se confrontant aux éléments culturels du contexte social taiwanais, les Jésuites subissent l’influence des autorités religieuses et politiques qui est a fortiori importante et directe. En deuxième lieu, pour observer l’impact du gouvernement nationaliste sur l’action des Jésuites, nous analyserons trois facettes de l’exercice de son pouvoir: les règlements juridiques, le Service de renseignements et les mouvements culturels. De façon plus précise, notre étude poursuit sept objectifs: 1) Présenter le contexte que rencontrent les Jésuites dans leur mission tant dans la pastorale que dans l’évangélisation, et les réactions qu’elles génèrent. 2) Explorer le rôle du gouvernement taiwanais et l’influence de son idéologie politique sur l’inculturation de la mission jésuite. 3) Découvrir les éléments liés à l’action du gouvernement qui entravent la mission. 4) Mettre en évidence le rôle et l’action de l’épiscopat dans la mission jésuite. 5) Analyser l’attitude des croyants et des non croyants envers la mission jésuite. 6) Etudier les solutions des Jésuites face aux problèmes de leur mission, et les conséquences qui en découlent. 7) Montrer l’évolution de l’adaptation de la mission jésuite et soulever le problème de l’inculturation. Avec la priorité nationale de la sinisation, la ligne de conduite adoptée par les Jésuites et les clercs chinois coïncide en partie avec celle impulsée par les autorités nationalistes. Cette étude s’intéresse aux impacts de l’idéologie politique sur le processus continu de l’adaptation théologique et liturgique poursuivie par les Jésuites. Nous tenterons de savoir si l’inculturation théologique menée par les Jésuites s’harmonise avec les réalités locales et correspond aux attentes des Taiwanais.| |We can precise the date of the beginning of the Jesuit mission in Taiwan with the arrival of Paul O’Brien in September 1951. The regime was then the government of Chiang Kai-shek. Our studies propose is to explore the Jesuits’ implantation on this island under the regime of Chiang Kai-shek. The problematical issue is principally organized around two themes. The first concerns the context in which the Jesuits were integrated: what kind of influence was exercised on their mission in this political context? How did the authorities exercise their influence on the Jesuits and the Taiwanese Church? What were the characteristics of the relationship that weaved the Jesuits with the political authority? Did the supreme national policy of the counter-attack on the continent and the anti-communism have an impact on the Jesuit mission? Which were the effects of the Guomindang’s ideological policy on the Jesuit’s action? The second theme is centered on the Jesuits’ initiatives: the approaches for implanting the Church, the reasons of their success or of their failure, the obstacles met in their missions and their contributions to the Taiwanese society. This study allows us to explore the mutation of the Jesuits’ missionary action, from its very begin to its decline. The subject is vast but our ambition is by no means to discover all the reasons explaining the rapid expansion and the decline of the Jesuits’ mission in Taiwan. Our focus spots on the reasons relating the government’s action and the social context. The economic rapid development during the Chiang’s government had an important influence on the Church, as well as on the change of the familial life and the mentality. We limit our issue in the study of the factors of changes concerning the Jesuits’ mission, just like the inhabitants’ emigration and the mutation of the society through education and employment. We pay a particular attention on the way of which the Jesuits apprehend the local culture, for adapting to the local people the Catholicism. In order to understand better the characteristics of Jesuits’ mission, we try to demonstrate how the Jesuits evolve their action from the “adaptation” to the “inculturation”. Basing on the notions of inculturation and of adaptation, we attempt to analyze the encounter between the catholic doctrine presented by the Jesuits and the Taiwanese people’s life; their reactions regarding to the problems will be studied: the management of missionary works and the ways of approaching the people are of these fields. The issue of inculturation is essential in our study. Even though the theory of the inculturation forms since the 1980’s, our study gets enriched in the light of this theory, including for exploring the Jesuits’ missions in China in the time of Matteo Ricci and equally for analyzing the Jesuits’ action in Taiwan in the 20th century. In order to understand better the characteristics of the Jesuits’ missions in Taiwan, first of all, we start from their origin of these missions, their relationship with the ecclesial authorities, with the Taiwanese government and the Jesuits’ leadership in Rome. Integrated in the Taiwanese social context, the Jesuits were subjected to the influence of the religious and political authorities that was a fortiori important and direct. Secondly, we attempt to analyze the impact of the nationalist government on the Jesuits’ action through three aspects of its political power: the juridical regulations, the intelligence network and the cultural movements.","(Lyon)|Academic Department:  History|Advisor:  Henriot, Christian",,French,CULL|REVIEW

Conversion is the shift that includes changes in the interior process of a person, the way one regards an issue, one's actions, and one's openness to God. Conversion is a technical word as defined by Bernard Lonergan in his book, Method in Theology (1971). It does not refer to a change of religious affiliation. It does refer to an inner change of heart (affective conversion), a change of viewpoint (intellectual conversion), actions enacted out of a choice of values over satisfaction (moral conversion), and ultimately the inner shift that occurs when grasped by God and moved in love (religious conversion). These questions will be explored through psychological considerations, understandings of spiritual development, theological reflection, and the call beyond to authentic self-transcending intentional loving",|Academic Department:  Theological Studies,,English,CULL|REVIEW

S. Eliot remains a literary giant close to fifty years after his death while David Jones, in contrast, is undeniably a marginal figure in the world of poetry but one who is slowly gaining a larger profile. Jones has from the very beginning been aligned with Eliot by virtue of Eliot's own comments and by a succession of critics who cast him as Eliot's disciple. The time has come, however, for the side notes to Eliot, which have become almost a convention of Jonesian criticism, to be expanded into a detailed comparative study between his and Eliot's work. Eliot scholars appear to show no interest in pursuing comparisons to Jones, as he is hardly mentioned, even in passing, in discussions of Eliot's work. This too, is something that deserves to be reassessed. Undertaking a new approach to Jones-Eliot comparisons develops Jones criticism and opens up a new branch of Eliot studies. This thesis repositions Jones and Eliot from the way they have, thus far, been critically related to one another by focusing on liminal space in both poets major texts: The Anathemata, In Parenthesis, The Waste Land, and Four Quartets. This threshold space can be found in their landscapes and in the way they adapt poetic techniques, such as imagery and juxtapositions of irreconcilable opposites. The between-space of transition manifested in their texts reflects the wider environment of flux and transition Jones and Eliot experienced in the first half of the twentieth century. Using the work of a range of literary critics, historians, philosophers, and geographers, including Arnold van Gennep, Victor Turner, Michel Foucault, Edward W. Soja, Michel de Certeau, Andrew Thacker, Thomas Dilworth, David Harvey, and Stephen Kern, establishes a spatially focused model of liminality which facilitates a close reading of these spaces in Jones's and Eliot's work.",,,English,CULL|REVIEW

At the heart of this preoccupation lie Balthasar's reflections on what Martin Heidegger referred to as the existential fact of man's openness to Being. For Balthasar, this Heideggerian insight is to be understood in terms of an encounter between finite human freedom and infinite divine freedom. One can argue that Balthasar's focus on ""the encounter"" is the internal logic guiding his literary output prior to the writing of his famous trilogy and that this internal logic determines Balthasar's understanding of the relationship between form (Gestalt ) and freedom (Freiheit )---arguably the two central themes of his mature thought. This dissertation examines Balthasar's understanding of the encounter, while attempting to document how the encounter is the interpretive key to his entire literary oeuvre. Such an examination will not only make possible a coherent reading of his overall thought but also present that thought in terms of a singular and ubiquitous theme. The first part of the dissertation will address the emergence of the encounter as the central preoccupation of Balthasar's thought. First, an analysis will be given of his engagement with modern German thinkers in his early work Apokalypse tier deutschen Seele, in which he identifies the turn to the subject of modern German thought as a tragic misreading of the encounter with the infinite. Second, an examination of Balthasar's subsequent theological response to the phenomenon of a dominant subjectivity will be considered in light of Balthasar's retrieval of patristic anthropology and Christology. The major patristic figures to be assayed will be Origen, Gregory of Nyssa, and Maximus the Confessor. The second part will document the development of a synthesis in Balthasar's early theological insights on the encounter by presenting the philosophical and psychological dimensions of the encounter that he provides in his Wahrheit der Welt and Die Christ und die Angst. The third part will explore the relationship between the two central themes of Balthasar's trilogy---Gestalt and freedom---and demonstrate how Balthasar's earlier work on the encounter is the key to understanding this relationship as it is worked out in Herrlichkeit and Theodramatik. Final remarks will address recent criticisms of Balthasar's thought, a proposal of the originality of Balthasar's reading of the encounter, and a critique of the only other reading available in English of the logic of Balthasar's thought.","|Academic Department:  Theology|Advisor:  Casarella, Peter",,English,CULL|REVIEW

I investigate the various ways in which worship within the Gesù employed sense perception as a method of facilitating devotion. In this vein, the use of preaching, visual arts, architecture, and music individually and collectively demonstrate that Jesuits were keenly aware that stimulating the senses would result in a more emotional and mystical form of devotion. For this investigation, the original sacristy manual of the Gesù is employed to reconstruct the liturgy. Linking this to sense perception, the long-standing tradition of the application of the senses within the Society of Jesus is explored. Also, this thesis analyzes how this tradition created a uniquely Ignatian liturgy in the Gesù that, while conforming with the Tridentine Church, was grounded in Ignatius’ beliefs that one could come closer to the divine through the senses.","|Academic Department:  History|Advisor:  Boer, Wietse de|Baernstein, Renee|Goldy, Charlotte",,English,KEEP|REVIEW

In each instance, the Jesuits faced obstacles to their efforts to Catholicize the Christian Orient. Through an examination of the Jesuit experience in the early modern Ottoman Empire, I argue that particular historiographical trends concerning confession-building, early modern empire-building, and globalization need to be revised. First, rather than seeing the consolidation and alliance of religious practice and political allegiance as institutionally forced through negotiation and resistance, I argue that the unique experiences of individuals demonstrate how confessionalization was not just a question of institutional control or communal solidarity, but was driven by individual desires to conform to a confessional identity, a process I call self-confessionalization. Second, this project revises the historiographical notion of the Jesuits as participants in European imperialism. I argue against the notion that the Jesuits were willful agents of European monarchs and the papacy, but rather that the Jesuits were forced to negotiate their place between Rome and the Ottoman world. They had to amend their missionary efforts based on the circumstances in which they found themselves, and this often ran contrary to the wishes of their patrons. Finally, I argue that the Jesuits in the early modern Ottoman Empire were equal participants in a global process of group identity formation that centered on the development and maintenance of borders along the lines of religious confession and larger cultural identities. They participated in this global exchange on both individual and collective levels, demonstrating that the early stages of globalization depended upon cooperation between the major powers of the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. In sum, the Jesuit missions to the Ottoman world lay bare the existence of intersecting processes","|Advisor:  Romano, Dennis",,English,KEEP|REVIEW

O caminho era uma trilha indígena da época pré-colombiana que atravessava a América do Sul, do oceano Atlântico ao Pacífico, passando por Paraná, Santa Catarina, São Paulo, Mato Grosso, Paraguai e Bolívia. Exerceu importante papel na formação do atual território paranaense, pois foi utilizado por aventureiros, jesuítas, exploradores e colonizadores europeus. Atualmente são raros os vestígios encontrados, porém existem documentos cartográficos e bibliográficos que descrevem sua localização, e, com base nestes traçou-se o roteiro do caminho sobre o atual território paranaense. A partir desta espacialização do caminho de Peabiru, foram realizadas pesquisas a campo, em nível regional, no norte da COMCAM, buscando levantar aspectos históricos e culturais da região, para formação de um banco de dados georreferenciados e criação do SIG-CAMINHO DE PEABIRU NA COMCAM. O banco de dados é a base para a delimitação de roteiros de peregrinação, que incentivam o desenvolvimento do turismo rural, e outras atividades relacionadas. Subsidia, também, a tomada de decisões por parte do poder público quanto ao investimento de capital, nesta área, e a confecção de mapas que auxiliam a análise espacial dos dados e a divulgação do turismo, em meio analógico e digital (Internet).||This paper discusses the application of geoprocessing in the creation of a data base and tourist routes, having as its central theme the Peabiru Trail, in COMCAM. At the Pre-Colombian time, the Peabiru Trail used to be a native trail that passed through the South America, from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean, going through Paraná, Santa Catarina, São Paulo, Mato Grosso, Paraguay and Bolivia. It had an important role in the formation of the current Paraná territory, because it was used by adventurers, Jesuits, explorers and European settlers. Nowadays, it is rare to find vestiges, however there are cartographic and bibliographic documents that describe its localization and, based on them, the route of the trail was traced on the current Paraná territory. From that spatial localization of the Peabiru Trail, field researches have been carried out in regional level, in the North of COMCAM, to try to gather historic and cultural aspects of the region in order to create a georeferenced data base and SIG-PEABIRU TRAIL IN COMCAM as well. The data base is the basis for the delimitation of peregrination routes, which is an incentive for the development of rural tourism and other related activities. Furthermore, it also subsidizes the decision making of the public power concerning capital investment in this area and the making of maps that help the data spatial analysis and making tourism known in analogical and digital (Internet) ways.","|Academic Department:  Geography|Advisor:  Barros, Mirian Vizintim Fernandes",,Portuguese,CULL|REVIEW

The technology of recording moving images on magnetic tape, previously of use only to broadcasters, became a tool for artistic expression, psychological experimentation, and political revolution. Video became portable not only materially but also culturally; it could be carried by an individual, but it could also be carried into institutions from the RAND Corporation to the Black Panther Party, from psychiatrists' offices to art galleries, and from prisons to state-funded media access centers. Between 1967 and 1973, American videographers across many of these institutional contexts participated in a common discourse, sharing not only practical knowledge about the uses and maintenance of video equipment, but visions of its social significance, psychological effects, and utopian future. For many, video was a technology which would bring about a new kind of awareness, the communal consiousness that—influenced by the evolutionary philosophy of Henri Bergson—Pierre Teilhard de Chardin referred to as the noosphere and Marshall McLuhan as the global village. Experimental videographers across several fields were also influenced by the psychedelic research of the 1950s and early 1960s, by the development of cybernetics as a science of both social systems and interactions between humans and machines, by anthropology and humanistic psychology, and by revolutionary political movements in the United States and around the world.","|Advisor:  Tresch, John|Cowan, Ruth Schwartz|Ensmenger, Nathan|Turner, Fred",,English,CULL|REVIEW

Religious conversion acts this way by transforming the religiously converted subject's feelings. Through this radical change in the subject's motivation, and the consequent change in the kinds of meanings that constitute the subject, religious conversion also transforms the nature of the human good of which the subject is a part.

Through a complex interaction of different imaginative functions, Loyola's text is able to superpose a variety of simultaneous narrative levels. In order to reformulate the ""greater narrative"" (the Magisterium) of the Roman faith beyond what is revealed in Scripture, the Spiritual Exercises require their exercitant to become an active participant in this narrative through constant visual contact with ""orders of corruption,"" that is, spaces in which virtue can be confronted with physical decay and sin. It is through these spaces that Counter-Reformation Rome (La Roma Ignaziana) will redefine the economy of salvation and diffuse the visual dynamics of the Spiritual Exercises throughout the Catholic world. Spanish Golden Age authors Miguel de Cervantes and Baltasar Gracian are well aware of this diffusion and use the rising Modernity of the novel to transform Loyola's notion of ""orders of corruption''; they adapt it to secular reality in their writings. Their encoded criticism of Loyolan imagination contributes to the epistemological crisis that marks the Baroque age, but also prepares the way for the crucial debates that will take place during the Enlightenment (such as the deconstruction of the Catholic ""greater narrative"" reflected in Loyola). This dissertation therefore concludes with a discussion of the eventual negation of Loyolan imagination in the novels of the marquis de Sade. As an ex-student of the Jesuits, Sade undermines the Roman faith by parodying the Baroque forms of spiritual visual experience and negates the Loyolan projection into ""orders of corruption.","|Academic Department:  Comparative Literature|Advisor:  Braider, Christopher",,English,KEEP|REVIEW

Through an examination of the first documented musical contact between the Iroquois and the Jesuits in the 17th century, Chapter 2 addresses the question of when, under what conditions and for what reasons the Iroquois adopted European religious musical practices. Through the musical experiences as documented in the official reports of a residential school, Chapter 3 discusses the changing attitude of Canadian officialdom towards Native people and the impact these changing attitudes may have had on the acquisition of hymns by Six Nations. It examines the way that Native people were perceived as indicative of the ""Indian problem,"" why government and residential school officials chose the policy of assimilation, how music was implicit in the assimilation policy, what effects this policy had on the way in which Native people were exposed to Western music, and whether these effects were lasting and total. By looking more specifically at one hymn, ""The Lord's My Shepherd"" and how its story reveals both its history and the processes of adaptation, Chapter 4 presents the history, performance aesthetics, performance practices and social meanings in a contemporary performance of this hymn. Embedded in its musical fabric are a number of genealogical threads: Scottish words sung to an English melody, acquired by the Iroquois, translated into Mohawk and using a performance style bearing a non-Western aesthetic. This thesis is illustrative of how one comes to appreciate the music of other cultures, and what responsibility a listener has towards coming to an informed understanding of another culture's music: through becoming aware of its values, history and social practices.","|Academic Department:  Music Criticism|Advisor:  Kinder, Keith",,English,KEEP|REVIEW

Through close readings, the dissertation draws attention to how Spanish cultural texts ranging from the 19th to the 21st century foreground that realist fiction's capacity to redeem and preserve certain events that have been left out of contemporary Spanish public discourse. The introduction presents a discussion of the views on history of Walter Benjamin, Hayden White, and Michel De Certeau, as well as a study of the conceptualizations of literary realism by Georg Lukács and Bertolt Brecht, and filmic realism by Andre Bazin, Siegfried Kracauer, and Gilles Deleuze. The first chapter analyzes three novels, Benito Pérez Galdós's La Primera República, César M. Arconada's Reparto de Tierras, and Ramón J. Sender's Mr. Witt en el Cantón, and Luis Buñuel's film Las Hurdes; Tierra sin Pan. These four works focus on the two periods of republican governance in Spain: 1873–74, and 1936–39. The second chapter examines Carlos Saura's film La Caza and Luis Martín-Santos's novel Tiempo de Silencio. My analysis shows how both works highlight the failure of Francoism through the representation of individuals who had not been assimilated by the pervasive narrative of the regime. The third chapter questions the unresolved problems generated throughout the Civil War and Francoism. By focusing on repressed memories as represented in Suso de Toro's novel Non Volvas, and the social exclusion generated throughout the post-Franco years in Alejandro González Iñárritu's film Biutiful, my analysis engages with the unsettled past, upon which a shaky present has been built. The dissertation further examines how conceptualizations of literary and filmic realism have changed over time, responding to transformations in Spanish society by adhering to a commitment to exposing the sufferings and contradictions inherent in society, and a strong interest in the everyday life of the middle and lower classes, challenging conceptualizations of history and time in Spain’s development as a nation.","|Advisor:  Moreiras-Menor, Cristina",,English,CULL|REVIEW

The marginalization of affectivity impoverishes moral theory and the moral life. Therefore, affectivity needs to be positively incorporated into theories of normativity and moral action. Karl Rahner's retrieval of concupiscentia lays the groundwork to reintegrate affectivity with the capacities of reason in order to utilize both as sources of moral knowledge. He asserts that theological concupiscence describes the existential relationship between nature (finitude) and person (freedom).|Rahner's perspective on theological concupiscence incorporated into moral theology with the fundamental option theory---which places human action in the context of grace---recast the manner in which moral theologians define and comprehend moral acts. Right action could no longer simply be read from nature, nor was right moral action achieved by simply following the faith community's norms and avoiding proscribed behaviors. Klaus Demmer connects the fundamental option to vocational decisions providing a framework for a transcendental analysis of moral action. In this context, the dialectical relationship between experience and insight comes to the fore. Insights set the stage for new experiences of grace, which in turn lead to nuanced or new insights. The nuanced or new insights should lead to new forms of action in the world.|Sidney Callahan, Beverly Harrison, and Margaret Farley deliberately integrate affectivity into their psychological or moral theory, offsetting the split between affectivity and reason. In doing so, they affirm the reality that as humans we are affective-reasoning beings. In addition, Farley uses ""embodied spirits"" or ""inspirited bodies"" to discuss human freedom and finitude drawing attention to our embodiment as an aspect of theological concupiscence. Together, they help recast the person-nature relationship (theological concupiscence) in a broader moral theological context allowing for a positive role for affectivity in normative and moral action theories. This re-configured matrix permits a more harmonious and reciprocal relationship between affectivity and reason where both can be utilized as resources for normative and moral action theories, enriching moral theory, our moral reasoning, and our view of the moral life.","|Academic Department:  Theology|Advisor:  Kopfensteiner, Thomas R.",,English,KEEP|REVIEW

I argue that extremely popular voyage narratives during this period reflected and shaped British people’s tendency to view Mughal Indians as similar and in some ways even superior to Europeans. This special status, which was also accorded to the Chinese, did not extend to American “Indians.” I begin my study with the origins of the mistaken term “Indian” as applied to American Indians by European “discoverers” in the late fifteenth century. Although the indigenous peoples of the Americas continued to be called “Indians” by Europeans for centuries after Amerigo Vespucci realized Columbus had “found” a separate continent rather than a new route to India, I argue that British writers were keenly aware of the difference between “Indians” in the Eastern and Western hemispheres by the mid-seventeenth century. In fact, before the death of the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb in 1707, British men and women greatly admired a country that was far more wealthy, spacious, and militarily powerful than their own. The inhabitants of the Americas, however, were decimated by the European transmission of smallpox and lacked the military technology of India and Europe. Consequently, the European colonization of the Americas, and its accompanying devaluation of the native peoples, began much earlier and lasted much longer there than in India (where the British presence did not become significant until Robert Clive’s victory at the Battle of Plassey in 1757). Peter Heylyn’s critically neglected 1652 Cosmographie (eight editions before 1700), a collection of voyage narratives from sailors, merchants, and Jesuits that represented at least a century of European perceptions of the rest of the world, shows that a sharp distinction was made between, on the one hand, the “Indians” in the Americas and, on the other hand, the inhabitants of the Mughal Empire in India proper. Drawing also on representations of “Indians” in the works of canonical literary authors in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries such as John Dryden, Richard Steele, and Henry Mackenzie, my dissertation provides a more nuanced account of the origins and (d)evolution of “Indian” stereotypes than scholars have to date.","|Academic Department:  English|Advisor:  Markley, Robert|Neely, Carol|Pollock, Anthony|Stevens, Andrea",,English,KEEP|REVIEW

Specifically, the project interrogates the Franciscan propagation of miracle-working objects--from the championing of popular Marian images in the seventeenth century to the crafting of potent sculptures and their dissemination in the eighteenth--and attempts to relate these activities to the socio-political and religious landscape of late colonial New Spain. Thus, the Franciscan advancement of numinous objects, seldom the focus of concentrated study, is here minutely examined and historically contextualized.|The Order's early investment in images--namely, the didactic image--was central to the sixteenth-century Franciscan missionary project. Yet while this period is traditionally seen as one in which the mendicant order rejected the concept of thaumaturgic objects--reticence towards the Virgin of Guadalupe is traditionally emphasized--the study argues for a more nuanced reading of the historical sources. Rather than define the late colonial Franciscan support of miraculous images as a break from sixteenth-century restraint, the current project chooses instead to understand how the Order's earliest strategies concerning images and their use set the stage for the future investment in numinous objects.|The dissertation interrogates the first Franciscan written accounts and activities that advanced the reputation of numinous, sacred objects and the Order's official attachment to sanctuary sites. Iconophilic praxis is examined in relationship to the onslaught of challenges posed by mendicant rivals--the Jesuits chief among them--and the Spanish Crown's own seventeenth-century strategy of transferring economic, religious, and political clout from monastic centers to the secular Church. The Crown's sharp and unforgiving policies would greatly intensify in the eighteenth century and culminate in the nineteenth. The same period, however, sees the establishment of the Franciscan missionary colleges of Propaganda Fide.|For Franciscan friars working under the banner of Propaganda Fide, spiritual reparation, religious renovation, and moral restitution formed a lexicon aimed at sustaining long-term projects of instauration. The late colonial promotion of sacred images became crucial to a buoyant Franciscan ontology: miraculous images reconverted lapsed communities, spiritually renovated ailing cities, battled Devils in Christian bodies, and announced mendicant piety and sanctity. Missionaries carefully sought to create and control a local cult of images in areas such as Queretaro, Zacatecas, Upper California, and Texas. The symbiotic relationship between the eighteenth-century missionary enterprise and the miraculous icon is most apparent in the history of a Marian icon from el Pueblito (Queretaro). Although the image's central iconography originates in a Rubens oil-sketch celebrating the Immaculate Conception, the visual theme receives the most exposure in the Franciscan strongholds of central New Spain where it comes to be strictly identified with the Order's conversion efforts. Thus, what began as an illustration of a controversial doctrine and its royal support in the Spanish Netherlands became, in Spanish America, a laudatory statement on the Franciscan missionary project. Yet the microhistory of the Virgin of el Pueblito also demonstrates the friars' strategy for the transformation of an illustration into a religious presence; in the town of el Pueblito, the Marian sculpture became an instrument capable of conversion, a holy image, and an object of veneration. With the story of el Pueblito, the dissertation enters into a more historical discussion of the status of images in the New World and interrogates the process through which an image came not only to symbolize something new, but to do something different.","|Academic Department:  Art History|Advisor:  Cummins, Thomas B.

A six-step process followed the completion of the collection of the data. The six steps are as follows: Initial engagement, Immersion into the topic and question, Incubation, Illumination, Explication, and Creative synthesis. All of these steps are interconnected by means of dialogue.|A special effort of comparing and sharing the opinions of the founding members, a true process of triangulation and member checking, functioned as a guarantee of the rigor and trustworthiness of the study (Moustakas, 1994). The researcher was nondirective and permissive in the dialogues and interviews. ||Major Findings: First, the set of characteristics described in the section A New Rogers-Freire-Goleman Paradigm of this study and attributed to the Magister Institute’s leadership style were substantiated by the research participants in their interviews and post-interviews conversations and dialogues with the researcher. It was the unanimous perception of all the members that this was a “group or team of equals” or a “consensus management group.” These two expressions seemed to convey in their minds that MI group reached the highest level of person-centeredness and attained an ideal form of personal and group consensus management. Secondly, the short-term goal of collaboration with the S. J. was challenged and a new concept of relationship with the Jesuits was embraced by most of the group members. Thirdly, the method employed has shown its usefulness to study action groups in a short period of time. Time and cost are two factors recommending this method. Fourthly, the highlighted imbedded sense of mission of the founding members made their unity and common vision a viable alternative. Finally, the heuristic phenomenologic method employed to study this complex and intricate religious organization facilitated its global comprehension while shedding light to understand the uniqueness and otherness of several of its key components.","|Academic Department:  Educational Leadership|Advisor:  Superfisky, Phyllis",,English,KEEP|REVIEW

The year 1540 coincides with the beginning of the Society of Jesus and their entrance into the missionary field alongside the Franciscan and Dominican missionary orders, all subsets of the Roman Catholic Church. The Jesuits' practice of first establishing respect, then influence, and eventually working for religious conversion proved far more effective than the relatively forceful tack taken by Dominican and Franciscan missionaries. While highly successful, Jesuit missionary techniques sufficiently clashed with the Franciscan and Dominican approaches to arouse the unwelcome interest of several papal inquiries, and contributed in large part to the dissolution of the Society in 1773. Within this era, three regions stand out as most valuable for their historical and biographical abundance, as well as their evolving political structures. India, Japan, and China all experienced significant missionary activity by different Catholic orders while their political systems evolved from feudal to national incarnations. Further, there was no dearth of European economic and political interest in these regions, creating a controversial social backdrop to missionary efforts very similar to that experienced by modern U.S. special operations personnel. Finally, the political, cultural and ideological characteristics are sufficiently varied between regions to permit distillation of a useful political and social influence heuristic applicable in a wide variety of special operations circumstances. The author examines the most successful Jesuit practices, creates a general model of their approach, and draws parallels to similar contemporary challenges to special operations forces.",,,English,KEEP|REVIEW

One of theology's most important functions is to furnish people with ways of perceiving these divine intimations in their concrete lives and relationships. Orientation to transcendental mystery is the sine qua non for initiation into faith. Theology must therefore lead people more deeply into the mystery of everyday existence as a preparation for the Christian life. At the same time, theology aims at expounding Christian teaching in as clear and intelligible a manner as possible. Theology accomplishes this by adapting its modes of presenting doctrine to the needs and capabilities of its addressees. This two-fold responsibility is properly understood as theology's mystagogical task. This dissertation argues that film is a crucial reference point for mystagogy--a locus mystagogicus. Film interprets human experience in ways conceptual theology cannot. It is thus a rich source for theological reflection. Theology is also an indispensable resource for film interpretation and a natural dialogue partner since it seeks to disclose the deepest dimensions of existence. More importantly, film needs theology as the hermeneutic that formally interprets religious experience--something that many human beings only vaguely sense, often misunderstand, and can easily misrepresent. With the help of film experts, theology can turn its discerning eyes to the stories and images of film and present viewers with a unique language by which they can articulate a response to their film experience. Film thus requires theology to bear witness to its artistry when it does succeed in opening people in wonder and humility to the ever-greater God. This dissertation in Catholic systematic theology investigates the theoretical and practical conditions of possibility for film as a locus for and of mystagogy. The question that it attempts to clarify is the extent to which Karl Rahner's fundamental theology provides an apposite and needed model for the way Catholic theology relates to film. There are three basic goals: (1) to outline existing ecclesial and theological foundations for a Catholic theology of film by way of a survey of magisterial documents on cinema and the writings of individual Catholic theologians and film scholars; (2) to provide greater theological grounding for Catholic approaches to film by developing the model that film is a locus mystagogicus on the basis of Rahner's transcendental method, creative retrieval of ancient mystagogy, and theological aesthetics; and (3) to test the viability and vitality of this model by way of analysis of the film Babette's Feast.","|Academic Department:  Theology|Advisor:  Imbelli, Robert",,English,KEEP|REVIEW

With a dialectical and philosophical-historical methodology (derived from the work of Theodor W. Adorno, Walter Benjamin, and Michel Foucault), I assemble archival traces of Venetian theatre prior to the construction of permanent theatre buildings in order to contribute to the writing focused on sixteenth and seventeenth-century Venetian theatre, of which currently little exists.

It shows how the English Crown gradually learnt to use the printed book as a political instrument. After a first period during which the authorities strove to master the polemical printed text, they made use of it in order to fight against the Jesuits coming from France as well as to promote the king of Navarre as a Protestant hero. Yet, Henri IV's recantation put an end to the English passion for Huguenot victories, even though they remained interested in French history books. James Stuart's coming to the throne in 1603, along with their experience of the previous thirty years, enabled English printers to compete with the new king for the spreading of royal treatises, in England as well as in Europe.","|Academic Department:  Anglophone Studies|Advisor:  Iselin, Pierre",,French,CULL|REVIEW

Working in the aftermath of the Council of Trent, these priests sought to establish a Roman Catholic identity for their parishioners while living and working in the midst of Protestants, Anabaptists, Hussites, and Jews. Anabaptists in particular found patronage under local Moravian lords willing to tolerate them for a number of reasons, including economic utility and personal conviction. An examination of the writings of Erhard and Fischer reveals a number of issues that permeated the course of Catholic counter-reform in this area of confessional pluralism. For in the absence of support from their overlords, these priests had to rely heavily on persuasive strategies in their published polemics. They drew upon a genealogy of heresy grounded in the history of the Roman Church, sought to trouble the|consciences of those lords who tolerated confessional pluralism in their domains, and promoted public Roman Catholic ritual practices, especially Eucharistic devotion through the annual Feast of Corpus Christi. Their work serves as an excellent point of departure for understanding how representatives of the Roman Church approached the problem of heresy in the Holy Roman Empire in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, especially in regions where the Church lacked the full support of local and regional secular authorities.","|Academic Department:  Divinity School|Advisor:  Schreiner, Susan|Gilpin, W.

It explored whether similar components within Ignatian pedagogy are fostered through other pedagogical approaches including, John Dewey's philosophy of education, critical pedagogy, feminist pedagogy, Service-Learning, adult learning theory, and Fink's taxonomy of significant learning. Results indicate the majority of administrators are very familiar with, and offer programs on, Ignatian pedagogy.

More than three-fourths administrators promote three Ignatian teaching methodological elements, Context, Experience, and Reflection, while more than one-half promote the element Action. Greater than two-thirds provide programs that foster the development of the whole person, service to others, and social justicecore Jesuit values. Further, more than three-fourths of Center administrators believe Ignatian pedagogy is viable for higher education. These results positively affirm the validity and viability of Ignatian pedagogy, a nearly 500 year-old Jesuit educational tradition and way of proceeding, in light of 21st century higher education pedagogical knowledge and practices. Recommendations include: increasing faculty knowledge of, accessibility to, and opportunities for critique and debate of, Ignatian pedagogy; expanding student evaluation to incorporate maturation and moral growth; and expanding pedagogical practices to include spiritual development. Other recommendations include mission development through pedagogical development, and formally requiring lay faculty, staff, and administrators to take ownership of, and responsibility for, fostering the Jesuit mission.","|Academic Department:  Educational Leadership|Advisor:  Cattaro, Gerald",,English,KEEP|REVIEW

The traits of love illustrated in the first part of the encyclical have been developed within a model of education enriched by the contributions of contemporary scholars as Bernard Lonergan (philosophy of education), Martin D'Arcy (anthropology), Paulo Freire (political education), Avery Dulles (theology) and Franco Imoda (psychology). Benedict XVI's notion of love-caritas-agape draws together significant themes of Ratzinger's thought (communio, faith-reason, ethics of witnesses, etc.) and is developed in his further papal teaching. According to Benedict XVI, love can be an essential animating force of Catholic education within the nature and mission of the Church; it is a form of evangelization, an authentic answer to the current educational emergency. ^ Moreover, Catholic education is a Church work of charity and mercy. According to Benedict XVI, this emphasis on love and its educational consequences should make the development Catholic education a priority for the pastoral programs of bishops and for the agenda of international leaders.|The findings of 'elite interviews' to international leaders of Catholic education completed this investigation revealing a generic perception of the potentiality of Benedict XVI's teaching about love as well as of the way he is challenging Catholic institutions to answer the current educational emergency. ^ International leaders of Catholic education are open to discuss these issues (because of their loyalty to the Church as institution), even if they show a general perception of how Benedict XVI's emphasis on love could challenge Catholic education. ^",,,English,CULL|REVIEW

Deep within its theological roots were embedded two parallel streams of thought. One was the indigenous collective point of view regarding human sacrifice as perceived by the Náhua people of Mesoamerica, and the other was the western Christian perspective on the soteriological significance of atonement. This dissertation is an analysis of the theological tension that existed between these two dialectical points of view, and an explication of how this dialectical tension is resolved through Hans Urs von Balthasar's theology of Theo-Drama and Josiah Royce's notion of triadic relationships. I argue that the Passion Drama of Christ at the San Fernando Cathedral brings Von Balthasar's Theo-Drama to a theatrical expression and offers a dramatic Roycean interpretant which I call a theo-catharsis in which the Náhua and Western perspectives which would split a community apart instead become interpreted into a Beloved Community.","|Advisor:  Garcia-Rivera, Alejandro",,English,CULL|REVIEW

The metaphors with which awe can be described therefore never fully define what it feels like to be affected by awe: awe is motion, elevation, lightness, and flight. As experience, awe constitutes a shattering jolt that brings about a fundamental and revelatory re-conception of life: a full awareness of the invisible life, filled, ""in a flash"", to the brim. This study explores awe’s coming to poetical givenness in the poetry of Gerard Manley Hopkins by taking into consideration experiential and existential as well as epistemological concerns. A phenomenological approach, for instance Edmund Husserl’s epochetic method and Michel Henry’s concept of the invisible, helps illuminate Hopkins’s poetics; a poetics which solicits a special focus precisely on awe in its various aspects. Hopkins’s poetry has a unique ability to constitute a crossing where in-depth feelings and forces of the wondrous in the striking aspects of awe can be vocalised. The focus on the phenomenon of awe’s poetical appearing therefore allows for a consideration of this life-transforming jolt as an irresistible force reverberating throughout Hopkins’s work and as such allows us to explore the experience of invisible life that lies at the heart of the possibility of conversion as a fundamental change of world-view.",,,English,CULL|REVIEW

Cette thèse est consacrée aux pratiques musicales et de danses en usage dans ce théâtre collégien. À l'issue d'une recension des représentations (établissement d'un catalogue des représentations et d'un répertoire de sources) et d'une reconstitution de plusieurs fragments musicaux, ce travail envisage l'inscription des scènes collégiennes dans l'espace artistique de la capitale, tout en les replaçant dans les usages pédagogiques de chaque établissement. Les conditions de ces représentations, leur publicité et les nombreux écrits qu'elles génèrent, enfin les acteurs et les milieux professionnels impliqués dans ces spectacles, sont successivement étudiés. La deuxième partie de la thèse est consacrée à un genre remarquable par sa continuité et son prestige, le ballet, l'élément le plus marquant et le plus polémique des spectacles de collège depuis le milieu du XVIIe siècle. Les spécificités du ballet de collège et leurs évolutions au cours de plus d'un siècle de répertoire sont analysées. La scène collégienne parisienne apparaît dès lors comme une interface, où se mêlent des acteurs et des usages chorégraphiques et musicaux de diverses origines et de diverses esthétiques.||During the 17th and 18th centuries, there were regular performances given by Parisian Colleges, the ten belonging to Paris University, and the one held by the Jesuits (College de Clermont, later College Louis-le-Grand), with variable pomp and success, in which music and dance took a significant role. This thesis studies musical practices and dances as part of these performances. A complete catalog of the performances and the preserved sources along with a reconstruction of musical fragments gives an image of the artistic life in these pedagogical institutions in particular and in the Parisian theatrical context of the period. The specific conditions for these performances, the numerous publications (programmes, commentaries, manuscripts, posters, etc.), the actors and their professional environment have been studied. The ballet, with its continuity and prestige, is the subject of the 2nd part of this work. Since the mid-17th century, it holds an important and polemic position within the theatrical performance. The particularities of the college ballet and its century-long evolution are analyzed. The Parisian College Scene appears as a place of multiple assimilations, with actors, chorographic and musical practices from various origins and styles.","(Paris)|Academic Department:  Musicology|Advisor:  Legrand, Raphaëlle",,French,CULL|REVIEW

But the intention is not to write a complete history of the Jesuits in the archipelago, but to contrast the image that they tried to offer about themselves and their environment with the missionary reality that they carried out before the expulsion from the hispanic territory in the time of Carlos III. The work is divided in three parts, preceded by a preamble. This is a brief historic introduction to the Philippine colony, from the first contacts with Europeans to the half of the eighteenth century, marking the main political events and offering some information about the political, social and economic system of the colony. The first part is a digest of the historical trajectory of the Society of Jesus in the Philippines from 1581 to 1568. In the second part we offer elements for the understanding of the jesuit evangelic enterprise in the archipelago, from an inner view of the Society. From the analysis of a lot of letters, we analyse some fundamental topics in the construction process of the image of the Jesuits and their work in the Philippines. The first topic is about the precarious first years of the mission. The second one is about the organization in the different evangelization areas that were in charge of the Jesuits. Finally, the hard conditions that the missionary defied while working on the ground. The third part of the thesis approaches the cultural discourse that the members of the Society constructed about the nature of their missional action in the Philippines. First, we analyse the works of the official chroniclers of the Province of the Philippines, and the work of other ""minor"" authors. We also study the vision that the missionary had about the people that they potentially could evangelise, especially Filipino natives and Chinese. The image of the first was very influenced by the previous american experience, with the pattern of the ""good savage"" and the ""monster"" as a reference. Meanwhile, the vision of the Far East and their peoples had a centenary tradition, and was always an utopia for the colonisers of the Philippines.",,,Spanish,CULL|REVIEW

The phenomenology of performing spiritual exercises in clinical pastoral care leads to a systematic theology for pastoral ministry. It integrates psychological and theological conscientization, transforming the participants through the self-emptying self-giving dynamism of radical love, even for the enemy. The love for God and neighbor provides a communal ecclesial space of encounter and conversation for all to share with the Spirit. Eucharist and Reconciliation offer the liturgical ritual confirmation of commitment to self-emptying self-giving, in imitation of Christ. As receivers of wellbeing from the Father who gives, we flourish, children in the reign of God. The ideas were developed in conversation with the letter to the Phillipians, the gospel of Luke, and first letter of John, the spirituality of Ignatius of Loyola, and of Augustine of Hippo, with the theology of Jacques Haers, Bernard Lonergan, Karl Rahner and Paul Tillich, the psychology of Carl Jung, and the postmodern philosophy of Jaques Derrida, Michel Foucault, Emmanuael Levinas, Jean Luc Marion, and Paul Ricoeur.","|Academic Department:  Sacred Theology|Advisor:  Sachs, John Randall",,English,CULL|REVIEW

This study examines the creation and change of dominant historical memories at four British palaces and ancestral homes. Through the close analysis of a variety of guidebooks beginning in the eighteenth century as well as other promotional materials such as websites and films, this study looks at which historical memories are emphasized for visitors and the reasons for these dominant memories. Place theorists such as Yi-Fu Tuan and Michel de Certeau as well as memory theorists such as Maurice Halbwachs, Pierre Nora, and Eric Hobsbawm have influenced the analysis of the project's sources. This inquiry focuses on four palaces: Hampton Court Palace outside London; Edinburgh Castle in the heart of Edinburgh, Scotland; Cardiff Castle in Cardiff, Wales; and Chatsworth House in Devonshire, England. The Victorians have played a large role in determining dominant memories at these sites through their interest in and focus on both the medieval period and objects in the home. Dominant memories discussed focus on the Tudors, medieval military importance, the myth and imagining of the Victorian medieval, the Regency period of Jane Austen, and elite family-home relationships.

F., 1904–1984","This dissertation articulates a critical social theory that is sympathetic to the emancipatory project of modernity. It argues that Western rationality should not be overcome but be rehabilitated, that modernism should not be abandoned but be redeemed, that the isolated, self-centered, disembodied Cartesian cogito should be rejected to allow the emergence of a decentered self, and that the objectified world of science should be repudiated to realize a lifeworld that is constituted by common meaning. It sees the possibility of completing the unfinished project of human liberation through a systematic retrieval and reformulation of the conceptual foundations of modernity, namely, selfhood, rationality, and society, which will form the bases for a radical critique and overcoming of the phenomena of alienation, domination, and colonization in late capitalism.|Lonergan and Habermas use two different paradigms in dealing with modernism. I argue that Habermas's paradigm of communicative action, which he develops from his critique and rejection of the philosophy of the subject, is based on a wrong understanding of the concept of consciousness as necessarily implying instrumentalism. This basic paradigmatic problem in Habermas leads to a neglect of the individual self, a one-sided conception of reason as merely linguistically constituted, and an excessively linguistic concept of the lifeworld that ignores the non-linguistic elements of social life. By complementing Habermas's communicative approach with Lonergan's paradigm of self-appropriation, we can recover a more comprehensive concept of selfhood that is embodied, situated, communicative, intersubjective, free, critical, responsible, and responsive to the transcendental precepts and validity claims. The Lonerganian reconstruction of Habermas's communicative rationality also leads to the recovery of reason that is both cognitively and linguistically constituted, critical, evidential, emancipatory, attentive, intelligent, reasonable, and responsible. Our reconstructive project also gives way to a concept of lifeworld that is both linguistic and perceptual.|The convergence of the two paradigms--communication and self-appropriation--is a new approach to modernity which we call ""new modernism."" The concept of ""new modernism"" shows that the emancipatory project of modernity can be completed through self-appropriation of the different levels of one's conscious intentionality in order to give way to a cognitive, communicative praxis that leads to truth, freedom, and justice. This process demands a further enlightenment, or what Lonergan calls Second Enlightenment, geared towards the restoration of meaning, empowerment, and emancipation through intellectual, moral, and affective conversion.","|Academic Department:  Theology|Advisor:  Marsh, James",,English,CULL|REVIEW

Lonergan's trinitarian theology as it pertains to a systematic understanding of religious diversity. Renewed interest in trinitarian doctrine as the central Christian mystery with practical implications for theology and praxis as well as the key reality and concept in a coherent and ordered understanding of the Christian faith connects this doctrine with many areas of theology. In the current context of pluralism as fact, trinitarian theology provides the heuristic and hermeneutic to understand and appropriate the meaning of religious diversity in the life of the Church.|This dissertation is a systematic approach to the question of religious diversity. Thus, it presumes and affirms conciliar dogma (the Nicea-Constantinopolitan Creed) and theological doctrines (the psychological analogy for the Trinity). The ""unified field structure"" proposed by Robert M. Doran, which is comprised of Lonergan's four-point hypothesis coupled with a theory of history, serves as the theological framework and foundation toward an understanding of religious diversity that is open to and anticipates new developments that are bound to occur through the ongoing conversations between the world's religions.|I argue that a Lonerganian-trinitarian approach will result in a new set of questions elicited by the context of religious diversity different from the current debates circumscribed by Christocentric, ecclesiological and soteriological concerns. Such an approach will result in a shift in discourse from causality to that of meaning and a concomitant movement from the metaphysical language and categories of a theoretical theology to the language and categories of a methodical theology derived from intentionality analysis.|Lonergan‟s trinitarian thought and analysis of human development from above downward that are explored in this dissertation are two significant areas that remain underexploited and which, I believe, have great potential for any theological enterprise. Relevant to this topic is the experience, appropriation and meaning of the religious Other and the difference upon which diversity is predicated. The implications of this study are better described as anticipations and possibilities in future directions that Christian theology and praxis may in positively evaluating religious diversity.","A thesis submitted to the Faculty of Theology of St. Michael's College and to the Department of Theology of the Toronto School of Theology in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Theology awarded by the University of St. Michael's College.|Advisor:  Doran, Robert M.",,English,CULL|REVIEW

Indeed, the real author behind this text would more likely be a French who is laic and lived in Quebec city during the early seventeenth century. This revelation makes the document unique, despite the Jesuit’s adaptation both in language and content. For instance, Father Jouvency, the editor of the De regione who inserted it in the Historiae Societatis Jesu, censured and added some informations to the original text. It now becomes crucial to investigate the real opinion of the French Canadian author about these ‘‘Savages’’ that he met?

This includes the historical becoming of humanity, the originality and absolute character of the christian phenomenon, the christian meaning of time, the harmonious relation between the two Testaments, the meaning of the ""time of the Church"", the fulfillment of humanity in history, christian hope and the final destiny of all creatures. For christians, Jesus Christ, even though he belongs to the past, remains the key to the development of all human history. Can such an affirmation be more than an arbitrary opinion without any reasonable basis? However, if this convictions is not absurd, then it has implications for the way we understand the evolution of epochs and of historical periods. It opens un a concrete way to experience time, including the time of the day-to-day, time measured by clocks and calendars. Hans Urs von Balthasar (1905–1988) in presenting his Theo-Drama (1973–1983), by using the meditation of theatre as literary genre and as dramatic performance, clarifies the originality that is specific to the decisive christian understanding of time - the time of the life of Christ: a time definitive and fulfilled that is the model for a christian understandingof time. Time and history are clearly developed following the linear schema of before and after Jesus Christ but they are also envisaged as arranged around Christ as center. At the crossroads of chronometrical time and time as the appearance and encounter of persons, the theatrical representation allows us to understand the aesthetic, dramatic and theological value of von Balthasar's conception of time and of history that is at once both linear and concentric.","|Academic Department:  Theology|Advisor:  Holzer, Vincent|De Maeseneer, Yves",,French,CULL|REVIEW

His claim to a legitimate voice lies in the tremendous amount of erudite knowledge he accumulated over the years, on many different subjects, and his classical education. Major focus is on his pristine awareness of the Anglo-Saxons and their language of Old English. Hopkins's unique style of writing poetry and his contribution to Victorian philology is highlighted. The work also deals, in some degree, with his mental state at various periods in his life, and attempts to disclose an overcoming of the anguish and depression evident in the poems.

Educators have promoted these practices as transformative experiences that encourage students to reflect critically on the world and their experience within it and to develop habits of engaged citizenship that promote sustained commitment to a more just and equitable society. The purpose of this qualitative inquiry is to interrogate and report findings for four key questions: How do college students make meaning of their service-learning experiences? How do service-learning experiences combine with other course activities and prior experiences and personal background to affect college students' attitudes about race and social justice? How do college students communicate what they are learning and the meaning they are making from service-learning experiences? What are the positive and negative effects of service-learning on the development of knowledge, skills, and attitudes about race and social justice for college students from racially and socioeconomically privileged groups? These questions are examined in the context of service-learning assigned as part of an introductory course on schooling in a diverse society within a teacher education program at an urban, Catholic, Jesuit university. Four case study narratives are presented to illustrate the experiences and meaning-making processes of students with racial and socioeconomic privilege. Also presented are findings regarding factors in five key areas across cases that influence service-learning experiences and outcomes: students' family relationships, identity development, and background; previous experiences with and exposure to diversity, poverty, and community service; current perceptions and expectations regarding race, poverty, and the role of service; service site environment, activities, and relationships; and the connection of service-learning to the course content, instructor, and teaching methods. Finally, implications are discussed for service-learning and teacher education programs, including student development perspectives, course design, service site selection, realistic expectations for courses and students, and the types of prolonged experience and cross-cultural engagement that lead students to develop a commitment to multicultural education and an ethos of teaching for social justice.","|Academic Department:  Education|Advisor:  Burant, Theresa J.|Pink, William T.",,English,KEEP|REVIEW

F., 1904–1984","It has been long known that groups of adults learn and enact their learning in certain ways; what is little known is how groups learn and how they develop in cognitive complexity. This dissertation proposes a theory of group cognitive development by arguing that intentional adult groups are complex and dynamic, and that they have the potential to evolve over time. Groups are complex in that they are made up of individuals within different orders of consciousness (Kegan), and they are dynamic in that different orders of consciousness interact and conflict (Lonergan) during the formation and enactment of group vision, values, and procedures. Dynamic complexity theory of group development as it is referred to in this study is grounded in Robert Kegan's constructive developmental theory and in Bernard Lonergan's transcendental method. While both Kegan and Lonergan attend to the growth of individuals, their theories are adapted to groups in order to understand the cognitive complexity of groups, intragroup and intergroup conflict, and the mental complexity of leader curriculum. This theory is applied to two case studies, one from antiquity in the case of the first century Corinthian community engaged in conflict with its founder, St. Paul, and in one contemporary study of American Catholic parishioners engaged in contentious dialogue with diocesan leaders from 1994 to 2004. The parish groups experienced a series of dialogues during a ten year period over the issues of parish restructuring and the priest sexual abuse crisis yielding cumulative and progressive changes in perspective-taking, responsibility-taking, and in group capacity to respond to and engage local and institutional authority figures. Group development is observed against a pedagogical backdrop that represents a mismatch between group complexity and leader expectations. In Corinth, Paul's curriculum was significantly beyond the mental capacity of the community.

The emergence of seventeenth-century Jesuit theatre innovations in eighteenth-century Benedictine and Augustinian school theatrical productions validates this conclusion and reveals a conduit of influence not previously articulated. While previous comparisons of Jesuit theatre main title dramas and Oratorian oratorios do not reveal a relationship, a comparative examination of the musical prologues and choruses performed within Jesuit theatrical productions and the musical works performed in the services of the Congregation of the Oratory over the period c.1550–c.1660 shows a parallel progression of development; the development of the oratorio in the oratories of the Congregation is a further demonstration of Jesuit influence during this time period. The friendship of Ignatius Loyola and Filippo Neri matured into a close relationship between the musical activities of the Society of Jesus and the Congregation of the Oratory during the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. The simultaneous development of the Jesuit school theatre independent prologue and chorus and the Congregation of the Oratory oratorio is one of the results of this relationship. The sacred musical works in Jesuit school theatrical productions and the services of the Congregation follow the same pathway of development and exhibit equivalent characteristics. A formal declaration restricting performance language in the Oratorian services caused the two repertoires to diverge c.1620–c.1630. A comparison of independent Jesuit theatre prologues and choruses and the oratorios performed during the services of the Congregation of the Oratory c.1640–c.1660 reveals that these two bodies of work are distinguishable from each other only by the language of the text.",|Academic Department:  Music,,English,KEEP|REVIEW

Based on a thorough and unpublished analysis of various archive sources, my thesis approaches the musical phenomenon of the everyday life of fathers and students, as well as of the magnificence of ceremonies, confronting the realities of these manifestations with the official rules and ordinances of the order regarding music. Four areas of research have been defined: 1. Music in Jesuit churches; 2. Edifying through singing: spriritual canticles; 3. Training and musical practices in colleges and boarding schools; 4. Musician companions. In addition, this study examines the life and works of the jesuit composer Louis le Quoynte (1652–1717), apprehends the realities of his musical activity within the Company, and finally looks into his productions (psalms, motets, spiritual canticles) in the musical landscape of this period.||Notre recherche entend comprendre les modalités du rapport des jésuites à la musique dans les provinces gallo- et flandro-belges – sur le territoire des Pays-Bas méridionaux et de la Principauté de Liège - de la seconde moitié du XVIe siècle à la suppression de la Compagnie en 1773.

In 1616 he suffered a severe persecution and was expelled from Nanjing. After five years of teaching philosophy and theology at the College of St. Paul in Macao, he returned in mainland China in 1624, resuming his work of evangelization in Jiangzhou.

A cause de la guerre de Trente Ans, la Réforme catholique ne put se mettre vraiment en place qu'au XVIIIe siècle. La prédication joua un rôle essentiel dans ce domaine. Encadrés par les directives épiscopales, formés à l'art oratoire dans les écoles et les collèges des jésuites et des autres ordres religieux (prémontrés, cisterciens, capucins), les prédicateurs enseignaient les dogmes et la morale du concile de Trente. Leur doctrine et leur morale optimistes avaient pour objectif essentiel la conversion des fidèles à l'idéal évangélique.

Led by the espiscopal rules and schooledgf to the Art of Oratory in Jesuit schools and in other Orders'schools (Prémontrés, Cistercians and Capuchins), preachers taught the dogma and morals of the ""Council of Trente"". Their optimistic doctrine and morals mainly aimed at converting people to the spirit of the Gospel.

Il en débattra à propos de la «juste guerre». Marqué par les personnalités du cardinal Mercier et du Père Lagrange, il démissionne de son poste de Rédacteur en chef à la Revue apologétique, quand un article contre l'Action française est refusé. Thomiste, il s'intéresse à la Patristique, mais encourage aussi les groupes d'Action catholique, souhaite rapprocher science et foi, s'engage en philosophe chrétien pour défendre Blondel. Repéré aux Semaines sociales par Mgr Saliège, il devient recteur de l'Institut catholique de Toulouse en 1932, charge qu'il garde jusqu'en 1964, y enseignant aussi la théologie. Appliquant la constitution Deus Scientiarum Dominus, il agrandit l'Institut catholique, ouvre un séminaire et lance des cours de théologie pour les laïcs; mais aussi, dïs les années 30, il en fait un lieu de refuge pour les persécutés et les opposants aux régimes totalitaires. Il est un membre actif de la Résistance spirituelle et intellectuelle contre le Nazisme et Vichy. Il est déporté en 1944. A partir de 1945, il devient le défenseur de la théologie française en aidant Teilhard de Chardin dont il diffuse la pensée, et Henri de Lubac. Trïs actif sur tous les fronts, il publiera tardivement les oeuvres pensées dans sa jeunesse. ||Apart from testimonials with a short biographical account, and proceedings of a symposium, no thorough studies on Bruno de Solages have come out, least of all a full-scale biography, in spite of his commitment in the crises of the 20th c.'s history of the Church or of Europe at war, a theme he tackled with the notion of ""Just war"". Deeply influenced in his early years by such figures as Cardinal Mercier or Father Lagrange, he resigned from Chief editor of Revue apologétique when an article opposed to l'Action française was denied publication. As a Thomist theologian, he got involved in Patristic studies, but also urged Catholic Action seminars to bring together Faith and Science, and as a Christian philosopher, fought beside Blondel for recognition. Singled out by Mgr Saliège during a Social Week session, he became Dean of the Catholic Institute in Toulouse in 1932, teaching theology too, until he resigned in 1964. As he implemented Deus Scientiarum Dominus, he made extensions in the Catholic Institute and launched theology courses for lay students; besides, in the 1930ies, he opened it to persecuted people or to opponents of fascist regimes. He was active in movements of spiritual or intellectual resistance to Nazism or to French Vichy government. In 1944, he was taken to a concentration camp. From 1945 onward, he became a staunch advocate of French theologians like de Lubac or Teilhard, spreading information on the latter's ground-breaking theories. Bruno de Solages remained active on all fronts to the end, publishing at a late age the works he had often conceived of in his youth.","|Advisor:  Cabanel, Patrick",,French,CULL|REVIEW

Likewise, many of these nonfiction accounts are written from a distinctly polarized place leaning either to science or faith. In this thesis, I mix research and history with memoir and a sense of poetry to explore my personal experience with this conflict. At its outset, I hoped for this project to capture my struggle as an orthodox member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS) in dealing with the questions my own sense of logic provided that institution. This goal was achieved in part. However, by the end of the project I had also captured a narrative exploration of my experience leaving the LDS Church and learning, instead of trusting the authority provided by a structure of orthodoxy, to feel comfortable trusting my own sense of reason. The first chapter captures my initial struggle with acknowledging questions within a religious structure. This is accomplished, in part, by merging the personal narrative with a researched account of French priest and paleontologist Pierre Teilhard de Chardin. I show both his struggle with questions and faith, and my desire to lean on his example as someone who acknowledged question without leaving his faith--in Chardin's case the Catholic Church. The second chapter, again following this pattern of mixing research with memoir, explores the feelings of exile I had during the time while I was still an orthodox member of the LDS church. This personal narrative is woven into several historical and literary accounts of exile. In the third chapter, I struggle with the question of what to do with the spiritual experiences I had during my time in the LDS Church after having separated myself from that institution. The short fourth chapter takes a strictly narrative line as I address my spiritual and mental outlook upon the completion of this project.","|Academic Department:  English|Advisor:  Sinor, Jennifer",,English,CULL|REVIEW

Son esthétique dramatique privilégie la dimension culturelle par rapport aux intentions édifiantes: fragilité des grandeurs, opposition entre sagesse et démesure. Relevant, par son écriture dans le cadre d'un collège jésuite, d'un théâtre pédagogique spectaculaire, elle s'inscrit dans une tradition encore récente d'un théâtre moral destiné à la représentation. Notre analyse étudie comment, en empruntant sujets et forme littéraire à la culture antique, ce Père jésuite, professeur de rhétorique, a composé ce corpus dans la tradition du théâtre humaniste, alliant tragédie et histoire, dans une dimension rhétorique qui répond aux exigences de l'enseignement jésuite.Bien qu'éditées en 2000 par R. Rieks (Petrus Mussonius, Tragoediae, Peter Lang, Frankfurt am Main, 2000), ces tragédies n'ont fait l'objet d'aucune traduction, d'aucune analyse approfondie de leurs sources antiques, d'aucune étude de leurs conditions de rédaction et de représentation, ce qui motive le présent travail, étude de la réception de figures historiques et de genres littéraires antiques, sous l'influence de la rhétorique.| |This study about Tragoediae sev diversarum gentium et imperiorum magni principes (1621) from Pierre Mousson (Petrus Mussonius), presents the reception of four historical figures of Antiquity when they were falling their authority ; but we focus our attention essentially on the preliminary play of the compilation, Pompeius Magnus, which is a tragic rewriting of the death of Pompée, and we analyse the development process implemented from an essential episode of the life of this historical character, with regard to aesthetic models of antiquity, from Greek historians to the Latin epopee. His aesthetics privileges the cultural dimension compared to the edifying intentions: fragility of splendours, opposition between moderation and excessiveness. Concerning the spectacular teaching theatre because written in the Jesuit colleges, it also falls under a still recent tradition of a moral theatre intended for the representation. We study how this Jesuit Father, who taught rhetoric, took inspiration from topics and literary form to the ancient culture, and composed this corpus in the tradition of humanistic theatre, by combining tragedy with history, in rhetorical dimension which fulfils the requirements of Jesuit pedagogy. Although published by R. Rieks (Petrus Mussonius, Tragoediae, Peter Lang, Frankfurt am Main, 2000), these tragedies have never been translated, their ancient sources never thoroughly analysed, and their conditions of writing and performing never studied ; all these reasons justify this work about reception of historical figures and literary styles of Antiquity, under rhetoric influence.","|Academic Department:  Ancient Languages and Literature|Advisor:  Chevalier, Jean-Frédéric",,French,CULL|REVIEW

La théologie s'expose à une constante tension: en effet, elle ne doit sacrifier un des deux aspects au profit de l'autre. Aussi doit-elle accorder une place aux sciences humaines et naturelles sans perdre sa spécificité. Le lieu originel de la théologie serait alors l'Alliance nouvelle et éternelle que Dieu a conclue avec son peuple dans le Christ: toute la réalité humaine y trouve sa place, se dirigeant vers son accomplissement eschatologique. La théologie s'enracine donc dans la spiritualité comme expérience de l'Alliance en même temps qu'elle approfondit la connaissance de celle-ci à travers le mouvement continu d'une pensée qui rend compte du rapport des deux pôles en relation, Dieu et son peuple.

The original place of theology would be the new and everlasting covenant, into which God entered with his people in Christ: all human reality finds its due place in it, moving towards its eschatological perfection. Thus theology is rooted in spirituality as the experience of the covenant, of which it deepens the knowledge as a continuous reasoning moving around the two poles that are in constant relation: God and his people.

The thesis includes a very brief historical account of the concept of analogy in philosophical and theological metaphysics, but has for its real starting point the exclamation of Karl Barth that the analogia entis is ""the invention of the Antichrist."" After exploring Barth's reasons for reacting so strongly to the doctrine, I discuss some of Barth's Catholic interlocutors' attempts to resolve the dispute. Then I attend to the question of form of thought, or Denkform, a term coined by Hans Urs von Balthasar in his study The Theology of Karl Barth: Exposition and Interpretation to express ""styles of truth"" in Catholic theology. Finally, I consider the original proposal for the analogia entis by Erich Przywara. My conclusion is that the analogia entis exceeds the requirements for openness set by Balthasar for a Catholic form of thought, and that it, as an essentially open metaphysics, testifies to the mystical end of finitude.","Based in Centrum för teologi och religionsvetenskap.|Advisor:  Hallonsten, Gösta",,English,CULL|REVIEW

F., 1904–1984","This dissertation explores Bernard Lonergan's notion of emergent probability as a world process which explains the intelligibility of natural evolution, human history and the human cognitional structure. It is the immanent intelligibility of the order in which ideas, insights, bias, events, things, schemes, institutions, nations exist or occur, reoccur, survive or seize to reoccur. Therefore, it is a worldview that envisions conditioned series of schemes of recurrences, their progressive, decline, reversal and defensive cycles, and their respective possibilities, probabilities, and actualities of emergence and survival.|The focus of this dissertation is not on emergent probability in nature, but on that of human cooperation based on conditioned series of schemes of recurrence of insight and bias with respect to the levels of operations. Just as human beings have a desire to know, they also have a desire to make, to create, to invent, to innovate and remake, re-create, reinvent, re-innovate tools, thereby accumulating insights and establishing higher viewpoints for further knowing, making and remaking. This desire to make and the pattern of technological experience presupposes the levels of operations: technology, economy, society, politics, and religion. These levels are interlocked in a complementary and interdependent operative scheme.|Man is most fundamentally technological. Technology is the first level of operations, a good of order, and the texture of civilization that clearly depict the recurrent schemes of human direct and inverse insights in relation to progress; dramatic, individual, group and general biases, and perverse inverse insight in relation to decline. Inasmuch as insight leads to the propagation of one wheel of progress, it also devises the defensive cycles that sustain its existence, through falsification of history, rationalization of sin and initiation of the “order of evil” and social surd.|In this dissertation, computer information system is a key illustration of Lonergan's notion of emergent probability. If information is a component of emergent probability, then information systems should aim at the actualization of insight as information. The emergence of information systems suggests the possibility of thinking machines, given that what is possible may become probable, and what is probable soon or later becomes actual. The assumption that thinking machines are actual and information as insight is not a bias may lead to the emergence of the algorithmic human being- a human being exiled from the orbits of authentic cognitional process. Insight is primary in the sustainability of self-corrective process of human cooperation and the creative integration of the levels of operations.|A possible implementation of an understanding of general notion of emergent probability and the primacy of insight as information can illuminate an understanding of the historical processes of the wheel of progress and defensive cycles operative in the African context. The good of order and the order of evil are initiated by power, liberty, insight or bias and the alteration of the first level of operation and the subsequent conditioned series of schemes of recurrence of human operations and cooperation. Hence, creative appropriation and technological liberation, and cosmopolis constitute a viable solution to the development of Dynamic System Of Integrity and Authentication for understanding African history. Authentic development, the good of order without an accompanying order of evil within the worldview of emergent probability is not possible without the transcendental precepts of being attentive, being intelligent, being reasonable and being responsible. Again development is not possible without cosmopolis empowered by the theological virtues as the way to overcoming the problem of practicality of the common sense. And also, the infusion of God's habitual grace in the human statistical laws shifts the probabilities of emergence of the levels of operations. The God presupposed by emergent probability becomes a solution to the problem of evil, the order of evil and social surd. Given that no nation, people or country can develop or grow under the exploitation of its enemies and friends, therefore Africa's development and growth cannot be achieved without conversion to the understanding of things as recurrent, without authentic actualization of insight as information and the redirection of education systems to reflect the technological process, the political will for its adaptation and its defense.","|Academic Department:  Philosophy|Advisor:  Byrne, Patrick",,English,CULL|REVIEW

Isso resultou numa multiplicidade de práticas educativas, gerando uma ordem pedagógica aplicável aos meninos tupinambás no Brasil-Colônia. Visamos, então, saber que elementos compõem essa ordem pedagógica quinhentista, pois tal ordem foi o tipo de discurso aplicado aos meninos indígenas durante sua educação. Como os jesuítas já recolhiam estudantes antes de vir para o Brasil, resolvemos panoramicamente saber como isso se dava. Denominaremos recolhimento dos meninos o dispositivo que materializou a prática educativa, própria do Ocidente. Tal dispositivo, retira esta tese do passado e a lança como problematizadora do presente, pois recolher e entregar são mais do que simples palavras, são discursos que ajudaram a construir, nesse caso, uma certa ordem pedagógica. Sobre isso, Foucault nos orienta. Afinal, por que razão, em meio a tantos descasos, entregamos e recolhemos as crianças às escolas? Sem meta explícita, esta tese acabou por questionar a noção de recolhimento como a primeira etapa da educação no Brasil. Porém, num exame mais apurado, descobrimos que o recolhimento é muito mais um dispositivo, uma prática, do que uma instituição em si. Se a escolarização brasileira só vai ganhar força no século XX, parece-nos, que o recolhimento foi uma prática que cotejou os primeiros anos desse século, fazendo, por exemplo, professores irem até as fazendas levantar o censo dos meninos para abrir escolas públicas. O recolhimento é a base discursiva da ordem pedagógica que atravessou a colônia brasileira e, quiçá, mesmo abandonado nos dias de hoje, ainda é utilizado pelos profissionais da área de educação, servindo, inclusive, como justificativa para barganhar as verbas públicas.||Its necessary to gain and retire the heathens sons: its a Jesuit axiom. That resulted in a great number of educational practices, conceiving a pedagogical order, applicable to the Tupinambas boys of Brazil-Colony. Then, we have aimed at knowing which elements made up this pedagogical order in the sixteenth century, for such an order was the kind of speech applied to the indigenous boys throughout the course of their education. Jesuits had already retired students before coming to Brazil, therefore we have decided to know it happened, why this became a western educational practice, removing this thesis from the past and throwing it to the present, because to retire and to give are move than simple words: they are speeches that have helped to set a pedagogical order up. On this we have Foucault guidance. After all, why we give and retire children to the schools? Without an explicit goal, this thesis has come to question the notion of retiring as the first stage of the education in Brazil. Yet, through a more refined analysis, we have found out that retiring is much more a device, a practice, than an institution. Insofar as Brazilian schooling will get strength during the twentieth century, we think that retiring made teachers go to farms to count boys in order to open public schools. Nowadays, retiring and guarding is still of use by the educations staff and may justify the bargain for public budget.","|Academic Department:  Education|Advisor:  Porto, Maria do Rosario Silveira",,Portuguese,CULL|REVIEW

Ce territoire amazonien, situé au nord-Est du pays sur une zone frontalière disputée avec l'Équateur depuis les débuts de l'ère républicaine, fait l'objet d'un projet d'intégration à la sphère étatique et nationale. Colonisation interne par des populations paysannes métisses, exploration du sous-Sol préalable à l'élaboration de plans d'extraction minière, pénétration des pratiques narcotrafiquantes, institutionnalisation des oeuvres scolaire et médicale: de confin relégué à un statut d'invisibilité, le Haut Marañón devient alors un front de progression de la ""société englobante"", nationale puis internationale. Cette recherche retrace l'histoire de la ""rencontre"" entre deux sphères culturelles, indigène et englobante, dont le Haut Marañón est le théâtre, de l'arrivée des jésuites en 1946 à 2009, date du Baguazo, un conflit sanglant survenu dans la ville de Bagua entre indigènes et forces de police. La thèse montre que loin de se limiter à une simple absorption du marginal par le national, cette rencontre a suscité l'intérêt d'une société civile encore en gestation, et précipité une remise en question partielle du paradigme historique de construction nationale, jusqu'alors sous-Tendu par des logiques socio-Raciales discriminantes et inégalitaires.||As an overlooked piece of Peru’s nation building process, the High Marañón region was mainly populated by indigenous, Awajún and Wampís populations until it was designated a Christian mission land in the middle of the XXth century. This Amazonian territory, located on the northeastern part of the country on the border with Ecuador, has been in diplomatic dispute since the early republican era. As a result, it became the focus of projects whose aim was to integrate the High Marañón into the nation and whose outcome was a number of new phenomena such as a process of “internal colonization” by peasants of mixed race, a series of subsoil explorations for mining extraction, and the institutionalization of activities related to education and health. From a forlorn land made invisible by the limitations of peruvian state apparatus, the High Marañón region became a battleground in the progression of global dynamics. This research aims to narrate the history of the “encounter” of two cultural areas, the indigenous one and the global one, from the arrival of the Jesuit mission in 1946 to the Baguazo event, so-Named after a bloody conflict between indigenous activists and police forces in the city of Bagua which took place in 2009. This research demonstrates that far from limiting itself to a mere absorption of a margin by a nation, this encounter has aroused the interest of Peruvian civil society, and partially called into question the historical nation-Building paradigm, in which socio-Racially biased logics have thusfar prevailed.","|Advisor:  Tartakowsky, Danielle|Compagnon, Olivier|Lempérière, Annick|Pelletier, Denis|Verdo, Geneviève|Drinot, Paulo",,French,CULL|REVIEW

Os escritos espirituais de São João da Cruz são utilizados como fonte de descrição do fenômeno místico. Inicialmente, foi elaborada uma interpretação do conceito de espiritualidade a partir da Psicologia Analítica. Esta interpretação – baseada na teoria dos arquétipos e do inconsciente coletivo, com suas implicações biológicas – apontou o evolucionismo como uma chave hermenêutica relevante para a compreensão da espiritualidade e da mística. O evolucionismo, questão central também para Rahner enquanto dialética na qual a matéria progressivamente adquire as características do espírito (a autoconsciência e a abertura para o Mistério de Deus), mostrou-se, assim, um possível elo de ligação entre Jung e Rahner na análise da experiência mística. No desenvolvimento do trabalho foram trazidos temas centrais na obra de Jung (tais como o simbolismo do Si-mesmo, a conjunção dos opostos, a alquimia) e comparados com os conceitos metafísicos utilizados por Rahner. Esta conjugação do pensamento de ambos autores proporcionou a interpretação da mística do ponto de vista evolutivo, o que implicou em considerações nas áreas mais atuais da psicologia científica, especificamente a neuropsicologia. A tentativa de síntese de campos abrangentes do conhecimento que representa esta dissertação é algo importante para a situação atual da ciência, reconhecidamente fragmentária e dispersa em temas específicos. Este motivo justifica um trabalho nos moldes de um ensaio exploratório onde se destaquem em linhas gerais conexões essenciais e relevantes entre diversas teorias, conexões que tornem mais visíveis a natureza dos seus objetos e sua relação com a existência humana.||The dissertation aims to analyze the mystical experience using the theoretical framework of the Catholic theologian Karl Rahner and the psychologist Carl Gustav Jung, founder of Analytical Psychology. The spiritual writings of St. John of the Cross are used as a source of mystical description of the phenomenon. Initially, an interpretation of the concept of spirituality from Analytical Psychology was created. This interpretation based on the theory of archetypes and the collective unconscious with its biological implications pointed evolutionism as an important hermeneutical key to the understanding of spirituality and mysticism. Evolutionism, a central issue for Rahner while dialectics in which matter progressively acquires the characteristics of the spirit (self-awareness and openness to the Mystery of God), thus proved a possible link between Jung and Rahner in the analysis of mystical experience. In developing this work central themes were brought in Jung's work (such as the symbolism of the Self, the conjunction of opposites, the alchemy) and compared with the metaphysical concepts used by Rahner. This combination of thought of both authors proportionate the mystical interpretation from an evolutionary point of view, which implied considerations on the most current areas of scientific psychology, especially neuropsychology. The attempted synthesis of broad fields of knowledge that is this dissertation is something important to the current state of science, admittedly fragmentary and scattered on specific topics. This reason justifies a job in the mold of an exploratory study where they stand in general essential and relevant connections between different theories, connections that make more visible the nature of its objects and its relation to human existence.","|Advisor:  Hammes, Érico João",,Portuguese,CULL|REVIEW

O objeto central de análise é um livro escolar publicado no Rio de Janeiro em 1883, o Manual de Estilo, de V. Sá de Menezes. Escrito para, segundo esclarece seu autor no prefácio, ""habilitar"" os alunos na ""prática da redação"", o livro se trata de uma versão em síntese do conteúdo presente nos manuais de retórica em circulação nas escolas do período. Em busca de entendimento sobre a tradição do ensino retórico com que o livro dialoga, parte-se de observações sobre os tipos de atividades de escrita propostas no Ratio studiorum, método de ensino seguido pela ordem dos jesuítas e que representa algo do que seria o ensino de escrita entre os séculos XVI e XVIII; posteriormente fazem-se considerações sobre a orientação pombalina para o ensino de retórica e de Língua Portuguesa. No capítulo 2, centrando-se então sobre o século XIX, busca-se um panorama da situação em que estariam se organizando o ensino primário e secundário brasileiro, a fim de entender-se o Manual de estylo em sua realidade de existência. A partir daí o trabalho concentra-se na leitura analítica do livro, o que corresponde aos capítulos 3 e 4 da tese, nos quais se discute a presença de uma concepção de linguagem como expressão do pensamento, as repercussões geradas por ela quanto ao tipo de ensino proposto por esse e outros livros didáticos do período e, no âmbito dos gêneros e tipologia textual, a presença da tipologia ?descrição, narração, carta?. Esta tipologia conduz as atividades de escrita do Manual de estylo e de uma série de livros de composição e manuais de português entre os anos finais do século XIX e iniciais do século XX, aspecto sobre o qual traçamos uma série de observações. A constatação do predomínio dessa tipologia para o ensino de produção textual nos leva à hipótese de que a tipologia ""descrição, narração, dissertação"" no universo escolar teria presença somente a partir do século XX, ponto de vista a partir do qual se conclui a análise. A fundamentação teórica da pesquisa tem sua base nos estudos franceses sobre cultura escolar e história das disciplinas escolares desenvolvidos nas últimas décadas por autores como Jean Hébrard, Anne-Marie Chartier e André Chervel. Para o estudo da escola e livro didático brasileiros foram referências centrais trabalhos de Circe Bittencourt, Luciano Mendes de Faria Filho, Antonio Augusto Gomes Batista e Diana Gonçalves Vidal. Sobre o ensino de retórica a leitura se ancora em estudos de Roberto Acízelo de Souza, João Adolfo Hansen, José Maria Paiva e Walter Ong. Sobre gênero e tipologia textual referências centrais vêm de Mikhail Bakhtin, Schneuwly e Dolz, Jean-Michel Adam, Guiomar Ciapuscio e Helena Nagamine Brandão.||This study is a result of a historical research about the teaching of composition in the Brazilian school. The work focuses a school textbook published in Rio de Janeiro in 1883, Manual de estilo, by V. Sá de Menezes. Written to help students in the process of writing, this book is a synthesis of the content presented in Rhetoric textbooks that were used in schools at the end of the 19.th century. Then, in the intention to understand part of the Rhetoric tradition that Manual de Estilo dialogues with, we begin this thesis discussing Ratio studiorum, the Jesuit school's pedagogic method. The goal was to identify different writing types of exercises proposed by the humanistic model of education followed by this religious segment. The choice for the Jesuits came from their importance at the Brazilian educational process during the period from XVI to XVIII century. From the second half of the XVIII century, we selected the orientation of writing education found in Verdadeiro método de estudar, by Luis Antonio Verney, and in Instrucções para os Professores de Grammatica latina Grega, Hebraica, e de Rethorica... announced by the Portuguese government in 1759. In the chapter 2, when we reach the XIX century, we present information about how the elementary e secondary schools were being organized, in order to connect the Manual de estylo to its reality of existence. The analysis of the content of Manual de estylo is developed between the chapter 3 and 4, when we discuss the presence of a conception of language as thinking expression and the repercussions of this understanding to the types of teaching proposed in this book and other textbooks from the end of XIX century and beginning of XX century. The typology ""narration, description and letter"" that we found as the core of the writing process proposed by Manual de estylo and contemporary books suggests us the hypothetical conclusion that the typology ""narration, description, dissertation"" might be an invention created in the XX century, what we discuss in the final chapter. This research is based on the French studies about the scholar culture and the history of the academic disciplines developed in past years by Jean Hébrard, Anne-Marie Chartier, André Chervel and others. For the study of the Brazilian school and Brazilian textbooks we have referred to Circe Bittencourt, Luciano Mendes de Faria Filho, Antonio Augusto Gomes Batista, Diana Gonçalves Vidal and others. About the teaching of Rhetoric we have based our observations on the study of Roberto Azícelo de Souza, João Adolfo Hansen, José Maria Paiva and Walter Ong.",|Academic Department:  Education,,Portuguese,CULL|REVIEW

E. Malpas, and Michel de Certeau, an individual's experiences inscribe a space (or an undifferentiated area) and make it a place; that place and those experiences contribute to an individual's identity. In applying this theory to early modern English drama, I contend that we can better understand how Elizabethan and Jacobean playwrights responded to the displacement of the English population, as many provincial English moved to London and acquired new physical and social places. Elizabethan playwrights Thomas Kyd and Christopher Marlowe suggest physical place is essential to a character's identity. For later playwrights like William Shakespeare and Ben Jonson, however, physical place is significant but not as central. Instead, as phenomenological theorists posit, place and experiences both contribute to identity.","|Advisor:  O'Dair, Sharon",,English,CULL|REVIEW

C'est pour lui un tournant, car cette nomination apparaît comme une réhabilitation pour un théologien longtemps suspecté d'incliner vers une résurgence du modernisme. Pourtant, il se considère comme un otage dans une commission largement dominée par le Saint-Office, et qui ne porte pas le renouveau qu'il désirait avec ardeur. Quand le concile commence véritablement, il se réjouit alors du tour pris par les événements, qui aboutissent à un large rejet des schémas préparatoires. Henri de Lubac est alors un homme en vue, tant ses travaux théologiques semblent être, avec d'autres, une préparation de l'aggiornamento. Pourtant, par tempérament, par prudence, mais aussi parfois à cause de la maladie, il reste, tout au long du concile, peu intégré à la mécanique conciliaire qui fabrique les textes. Au fur et à mesure des quatre sessions, il balance entre l'espoir du renouveau et les craintes de voir le concile mal compris, surtout en ce qui concerne les questions de relations entre l'Eglise et le monde, notamment en raison d'une crise spirituelle qu'il discerne, tout spécialement en France et dans la Compagnie de Jésus. Reste tout de même l'influence de l'œuvre du Père de Lubac sur l'œuvre conciliaire, difficile à mesurer, parce qu'elle se confond avec celle d'autres théologiens, soucieux comme lui de redonner à la théologie un fondement christologique et un respect du Mystère.||In 1960, the French jesuit Henri de Lubac became consultor to the Preparatory theological commission of the Second Vatican council. It was a turning point for him, because this appointment was understood as a rehabilitation. He was indeed, for a long time, suspected to be a neo-modernist theologian. Though, he thought he was an hostage in a commission which was dominated by the Holy Office to a large extent, and which did not promote the renewal he was waiting for eagerly. When the council began really, he was really satisfied by the events that led to a large rejection of the preparatory texts. Henri de Lubac was then a well-known man because of his books and articles which were like a preparation of the Second Vatican council. Through, because of the illness sometimes, of his character, and of his caution will, he remained, during the whole council, not really inserted in the networks that made the texts. As the council went along, Henri de Lubac was both happy of the aggiornamento, and worried about a possible misunderstanding of the council, especially about the Church and world relation. Indeed, he thought this misunderstanding was made easier by the spiritual crisis which grew up in France, according to him, and especially in the Company of Jesus. However that may be, Henri de Lubac has had an influence on this council by his books and articles, even if it is quite difficult to measure, because it is mixed with the influence of other theologians who wanted, like him, to promote a christological theology, which would have more respect for the Mystery.","Résumés en français et en anglas.|Academic Department:  History|Advisor:  Prévotat, Jacques",,French,CULL|REVIEW

The struggles Carroll faced were the legacy of the English heritage of the colonies. English Catholics who shaped colonial Catholic life made the community private and personal in response to the religious atmosphere in the English world. The American Revolution brought toleration for Catholics and they struggled to adapt their hierarchal religion to new republican language. Some congregations went as far as to deny episcopal power, a theory known as trusteeism. Different interpretations struggled to gain prominence and the issue was not resolved until decades after Carroll’s death in 1815. Yet the Church he left behind provided a strong base for later immigrants who nonetheless dramatically changed the face of the American Catholic Church.","|Advisor:  Robinson, David",,English,CULL|REVIEW

Après avoir livré ses premières impressions, le jésuite mit au point son programme apostolique, faisant appel à une méthode « audio-visuelle » fondée sur le dessin didactique. Mais le jésuite fut aussi un formidable voyageur, qui se rendit non seulement en Iroquoisie, mais aussi en Nouvelle-Angleterre. Il semble bien que ce soit grâce à de précieux réseaux de connaissances en dehors de ceux de la Compagnie de Jésus qu'il put entreprendre un tel voyage.

Arriving from Lorraine in 1667, Pierron participated in the Catholic mission to the Mohawk of the Hudson Valley, after being formally introduced to delegates of this nation by the intendant Jean Talon. Working in a half-dozen villages, Pierron designed an audiovisual method of conversion based upon didactic drawings and paintings. The missionary was also an energetic traveller, both within Mohawk territories and to the English colonies. These journeys point to Pierron’s earlier experiences and more precisely, to the network of contacts he seems to have developed in Europe.

F., 1904–1984","Virtue ethics bases moral decision-making, in part, in a skills-like ability to spot morally salient features in the phenomenal world. Aristotle, an exemplar of such ethics, developed a theory of practical wisdom (phronesis) wherein the person of moral expertise makes sound ethical judgments and decisions via direct insight into concrete circumstances. Phronesis involves emotive discernment and agent-relative construal of the world. But emotions and perspectives can also be linked with bias and poor judgment. How are we to think about objectivity if virtue ethics relies upon such apparently subjective factors as emotively influenced dispositions? Bernard Lonergan developed a theory of insight-based human understanding and explores its operation in the concrete circumstances of practical living. His theory offers a process of human learning and knowing that does not avoid emotions and agent-perspectives but seeks to so operate within these factors as to produce a state we could validly call 'being objective.' Agreeing with Aristotle on a key role for emotions, Lonergan goes much further in claiming that some mode of the emotion of love should play a critical role in attaining the insights required for virtue ethics. His treatment of love, however, remains vague. Martha Nussbaum, on the other hand, provides very rich treatment of how love, understood as compassion, can act as a control for perspectival discernment and moral insight. Her theory fills out Lonergan's, allowing us more clearly to see how love (and other emotions) could be conducive to fostering objective viewpoints within morally charged circumstances. Objectivity in virtue ethics can be understood, then, to be what we are more or less attaining to the degree that we self-consciously apprehend and deploy our innate modes of insight-induction and aim these cognitive processes toward a world construed by a background concern of care and compassion.",|Academic Department:  Philosophy,,English,CULL|REVIEW

Para Suárez el poder político reside originaria y naturalmente en la comunidad, pero ésta puede transferirlo a otro titular. El poder político surge para la realización del bien común y es ésta la finalidad que debe orientar la acción del gobernante; de otro modo es legítima la resistencia. Ahora bien, Suárez desvincula el origen popular del poder del derecho de resistencia: el hecho de que el poder proceda del pueblo no significa que éste pueda recuperarlo ni limitarlo arbitrariamente una vez transferido. Lo que sí retiene el pueblo es el derecho natural a la legítima defensa y, por lo tanto, la resistencia al tirano. La persecución del bien común en las particulares circunstancias del caso concreto determina en Suárez la aceptación de la resistencia, así como las condiciones, límites y fines de ésta. La resistencia a la tiranía supone en Suárez un importante límite fáctico y no institucional al poder político. Es más, en el plano de los hechos, la resistencia civil operaría en el sistema político suareciano a modo de medio de control democrático no institucionalizado del poder político. En un plano más institucional Suárez sostiene que el tirano mal gobernante con justo título puede ser depuesto mediante sentencia emitida por la comunidad, o bien por el papa. Los presupuestos del pensamiento político suareciano, unidos a la finalidad del mismo (búsqueda del bien común efectivo) conforman un enfoque pragmático-fáctico que busca una justicia material que se concreta en la realidad histórica del sujeto social y de la comunidad en que éste se inserta. Como consecuencia, en el sistema político suareciano las respuestas concretas son secundarias. Y, en segundo lugar, la búsqueda del bien común efectivo y real desde la adaptabilidad que le permite su enfoque conduce a Suárez a la aceptación de la resistencia civil. Este enfoque supera la ideologización abstracta moderna. El objeto, propósito, enfoque y, sobre todo, la metodología del presente trabajo de investigación han determinado que se haya seguido el siguiente esquema, que presentamos sumariamente al lector. En el capítulo primero se aborda brevemente la vida y obra de nuestro autor, las realidades contextuales que permiten situar ambas y las diferentes visiones interpretativas desde las que cabe entenderlo. En el capítulo segundo se intenta ofrecer sucintamente un breve relato de los hitos históricos más relevantes de la cuestión de la resistencia antes de Suárez, así como del importante desarrollo que este tema tuvo en los tiempos inmediatamente precedentes a este autor. Adicionalmente, se alude al contexto histórico concreto que mueve a Suárez a escribir de manera más extensa sobre esta materia. En el capítulo tercero se procura esbozar las líneas fundamentales del pensamiento político suareciano que están vinculadas con la resistencia a la tiranía. En el capítulo cuarto se trata la resistencia tal como aparece en la obra de Suárez, comentando diversas cuestiones a modo de glosa aclarativa e interpretativa. En el capítulo quinto exponemos nuestra interpretación sobre el significado de la resistencia y su conjugación con la noción de poder político en Suárez.","|Advisor:  Senent de Frutos, Juan Antonio|Margenat Peralta, Josep María",,Spanish,CULL|REVIEW

They do not consider Chinese philosophy as a philosophy but regard its contributions as wisdoms, thoughts or spiritualities. My study attempts to understand this fact by identifying the emergence of such representation across several centuries and starts with its reception in France through Jesuit missionaries in the sixteenth century. This thesis argues that French philosophers' representation of Chinese philosophy is an Orientalist legacy that French philosophers and scholars have built from a distorted, biased and reductionist view of China and its philosophy as formulated by the Jesuits. This problem of the existence of Chinese philosophy can only be understood if it is approached in relation to the eurocentric and Orientalist ideology that characterizes philosophy and addressed through the intellectual coloniality that dominates traditional epistemology by deconstructing it.","|Academic Department:  Philosophy|Advisor:  Pinchard, Bruno|Lee, Gregory B.",,French,CULL|REVIEW

I hypothesize that the Jesuit educational model of the Casa program is a form of peace education that contributes to the formation of agents of positive peace (social justice). To test this hypothesis, I begin by exploring the theoretical links between Chadwick Alger’s model of peace education and the Jesuit educational model of the Casa program. I then explore student perceptions of the impact of the Casa program on their personal development and on their long-term commitment to promoting positive peace by asking two additional questions: (A) How does participation in the Casa de la Solidaridad program influence student understanding of the program’s three key educational goals: (1) education for justice, (2) men and women for others, and (3) global citizenship? (B) How have these three goals (education for justice, men and women for others, and global citizenship), if at all, influenced students’ vocational choices after their completion of the program?|To explore the impact of the program on student development, I used a descriptive case study model. To gain insights into the effects of the Casa experience on students, I conducted 24 interviews primarily using in-depth questionnaires to gather my data. To develop a thick description of the Casa experience, I used both theoretical insights and coding methods.|The findings showed that respondents felt they were profoundly impacted by their experience in the Casa program. In particular, the direct experience in Salvadoran communities through their praxis placement produced a deep sense of solidarity and generated a yearning, and in many cases a feeling of responsibility, to use their vocation as a means of advancing social justice. Based on my findings, I conclude that the Jesuit educational model of the Casa program is contributing to the formation agents of positive peace through a form of peace education.","|Advisor:  Rodriguez, Jeanette",,English,KEEP|REVIEW

In doing so, it seeks to split a gap between Foucault's ideas about nineteenth-century life and Ian Watt's account of the novel genre's rise. It claims that in the first instance, it is easy to feel that distance is compromised, through social surveillance, only disempoweringly; while in the second, it is easy to read aloneness as public triumph as the basis of an ethos of economic independence. It therefore studies texts from the era that admit that being alone cannot be ''pure'' in modern times, yet which show that partialness in solitude can be a boon, helping subjects mediate the plural demands of modernity. Building on the scholarship of Jeff Nunokawa, Christopher Lane, and Amanda Anderson, the current study departs from it by not privileging solitude that implies a rare event, but rather, attends to the mundane. Focusing respectively on women's time, women's space, and economic organization of women's time and space, the first three chapters make a case for reading a trio of prominent texts—Persuasion, Villette, and The Odd Women—through an undernoted support for women's right to withdrawal. As for Dickens's Our Mutual Friend, it shows women gaining ground through co-opting alienation, yet cannot keep from wanting to contain female cleverness as a rule, making it resist and bolster strains of social hypocrisy. Notably, each novel here crafts an ending that rewards strong solitaries with affection. Without erasing solo resilience, they imagine solitaries ''alone together'' in relations that take cues from canny ways of navigating self and world—in other words, that take cues from proactive distance itself. Thus, while the phrase ''the ends of aloneness'' speaks to aims and goals for conduct, another aspect has to do with the forms of closing scenes. Refashioning the marriage plot to acknowledge solo strength, the novels here make social distance anchor new relational forms that combine eccentric views, yet further blend oddities with careful social concessions into patterns of compromise.","|Advisor:  Bernstein, Susan D.",,English,CULL|REVIEW

The broadcasting of vernacular culture will be shown to foster intimate and interactive relationships between broadcasters and audiences. Using a theoretical framework that draws upon the work of communications theorists Harold Innis and Walter Ong, the thesis will explore the (secondary) orality of radio broadcasting, and will consider instances in which the normative unidirectional structure and 'passive' orality of radio has been (and can be) made reciprocal and active through the participation of listeners. The inclusion of 'lay voices' and 'vernacular input' in radio broadcasting will be charted as a measure of the democratization of radio, and in order to demonstrate radio's role in disseminating oral history, promoting dialogue, and building and binding communities. The thesis will predominantly focus on local and regional forms of radio: the BBC Regions in the post-war era; regional radio programming serving the Canadianprovince ofNewfoundland both pre- and post-Confederation (which took place in 1949); and the community radio sector in the UK during the last five years. A common theme of many of the case studies within the thesis will be the role of citizen participation in challenging, transgressing or eroding editorial control, institutional protocols and the linguistic hegemony of radio production. Conversely, close attention will be given to the ways in which editorial control in radio production has circumscribed the self-definition of participants and communities. These case studies will provide evidence with which to investigate the following research question - is the democratization of radio possible through the incorporation of citizen voices or messages within radio production or programming, or is it only possible through changing the medium itself through citizen participation in democratic structures of production, management and ownership?.",,,English,CULL|REVIEW

The problem of evil, in essence, asks, Why is evil present in the creation of an omnipotent and omnibenevolent God? Chapter 1 defines basic terms, such as 'problem of evil' and 'theodicy,' and frames the debate on evil and theism using recent work in analytic philosophy. I begin with David Hume's attack on 'natural religion' based on the reality of evil. The work of Hume sets the stage for later debates on evil in the analytic philosophy of religion. After Hume, I move to J. L. Mackie's presentation of the atheistic argument from evil, with a focus on Mackie's attack on the free-will defense. I then examine Alvin Plantinga's response to Mackie and Plantinga's endorsement of the free-will defense against Mackie's attack. My discussion of the pivotal Mackie-Plantinga debate on the problem of evil is followed by an examination of three contemporary figures within analytic philosophy who have offered Christian responses to the problem of evil---John Hick, Eleonore Stump, and Marilyn McCord Adams. In the midst of this discussion, I pause to compare the proposals of Plantinga, Hick, Richard Swinburne, and Peter van Inwagen on natural evil. Chapter 2 examines the trinitarian theology of Hans Urs von Balthasar in the context of recent and contemporary trinitarian theology, because I will argue that the doctrine of the Trinity is the essential Christian resource needed to answer the problem of evil. After rehearsing and critiquing the popular story of the rise and fall of trinitarian theology, as told by Karl Rahner, Catherine LaCugna, and others, I examine the tentative place of the Trinity in the doctrinal theology of Friedrich Schleiermacher and Paul Tillich and then the renewed emphasis on the Trinity found in Karl Barth and Rahner. The work of Barth and Rahner provides the framework in which to consider the thought of several major contemporary theologians on the Trinity---Jurgen Moltmann, Walter Kasper, Wolfhart Pannenberg, and John Zizioulas. Once the context has been set, I turn fully to the theology of the Trinity of Hans Urs von Balthasar. I argue that Balthasar's primary account of the immanent Trinity is one of reciprocal, self-giving, interpersonal love dynamically exchanged among distinct divine persons, who share fully and equally in the one divine essence of kenotic love, and that the economic Trinity, particularly in the Cross of Christ, makes trinitarian love present to human persons. In Chapter 3 I develop a theodicy based on Balthasar's theology of the Trinity. I begin by discussing the nature and purpose of theodicy and various recent attacks on the validity of the theological enterprise of theodicy. After clarifying the theological aims of a Christian theodicy, and setting to the side common but inadequate responses to the problem of evil, I turn to my own understanding of a successful Christian theodicy. I begin with Scripture (Genesis, Job, and the Gospels) and then use Pope John Paul II's Salvifici Doloris as a bridge from the Gospel account of the life of Christ to Balthasar's theology of the Trinity and its application to theodicy. I argue that Balthasar's interpersonal model of the Trinity as a life of communal self-giving love and Balthasar's grounding of the economy of salvation in the immanent Trinity provide the proper framework for answering the problem of evil from a Christian theological perspective. I conclude that human suffering, united to the Cross of Christ, becomes a participation in the life of the Triune God in a way that renders such suffering of great salvific value to the one who suffers and that thus justifies God's permission of innocent suffering. Finally, as a connection between Balthasar's work and American popular culture, I observe the trinitarian features of the response to the problem of evil found in William P. Young's recent best-selling novel The Shack and discover claims concerning the Trinity and theodicy that resonate deeply with the theology of Balthasar.

The majority of the dissertation's work consists in uncoupling Rahner's difficult term, Vorgriff, from the metaphorical associations of grasping (greifen) latent within it. This uncoupling occurs in various phases, passing through Rahner's appropriations of Thomas Aquinas and Ignatius of Loyola and his teachings on grace, mystery, and eschatology, Martin Heidegger's readings of Friedrich Nietzsche, Friedrich Hölderlin, and Rainer Maria Rilke, and the sublime-aesthetics of Jean-François Lyotard, Jean-Luc Nancy and Jean-Luc Marion.

Les missions des Jésuites en Chine depuis la fin du XVIIe siècle assurent la continuation de la présentation de cet art de manière plus précise et concrète durant tout un siècle. On peut distinguer trois périodes chronologiques: la première période est représentée par le rejet, l'incompréhension ou de simples croquis de l'architecture chinoise. Les représentants en sont le Père Louis Le Comte et des autres premiers Jésuites en Chine; la deuxième période montre une certaine acceptation de l'art chinois. Les présentions des Jésuites, bien que neutres, ouvrent la voie en Europe à une vague orientaliste. Le Frère Attiret est le représentant de cette période. Dès la publication de sa lettre en 1749, l'Europe pose son regard sur le jardin chinois, particulièrement à travers Yuan ming yuan. Cette lettre contribue alors à la création des parcs ""imités de la Chine"" à travers toute l'Europe; la troisième période est caractérisée par les ouvrages des jésuites dont le séjour en Chine s'étend à la deuxième moitié du XVIIIe siècle, surtout de ceux qui ont réalisé les ""Mémoires concernant des Chinois"". Le Père Cibot est l'auteur le plus brillant, il tente d’élaborer une théorie du jardin chinois. Il traduit un poème de Sima Guang qui montre la façon dont les Chinois lettrés conçoivent leur jardin et publie un essai sur le jardin chinois qui a permis aux Européens d'approfondir leurs connaissances.||18th century Europe already knew about Chinese architecture through the drawings shown on the manufactured goods that had been sent in for long. Since the end of the 17th century, the detailed reports from the Jesuits living in China allowed the introduction of Chinese art into Europe, in a more complete and precise way. We can divide this introduction into three chronological periods: The first one is a period of reject, of misunderstanding due to the superficiality of the sketches about Chinese architecture, represented by Father Louis Le Comte and other first Jesuits in China. The second period shows, to certain extend a better acceptation of Chinese architecture. The presentations done by the Jesuits, although neutral, open the way to an orientalistic wave in Europe. Father Attiret is representative of this period. As soon as his letter is published, in 1747, Europe's interest grows on Chinese gardens, particularly Yuan Ming Yuan. His letter contributes then to the creation of parks and gardens ""in the Chinese way"" all over Europe. The third period is characterized by the works of Jesuits who stayed in China as long as the second part of the 18th century, mainly those who contributed to the ""Mémoires concernant des chinois"". Father Cibot is the most brilliant author about architecture, with his theory on the Chinese garden. His translation of a poem by Sima Guang shows the manner used by lettered Chinese people to create their own gardens, while deepens the European people's approach to the subject.","|Academic Department:  French Literature and Civilization|Advisor:  Didier, Béatrice",,French,CULL|REVIEW

Macleod's Alexander MacDonald and Laurence's Morag Gunn seek an historical context in which to locate themselves, and their ancestral stories help to form the underpinnings of their individual identities, but also challenge each protagonist to re-mediate these experiences through the lens of the more advanced modes of communication that are available in the late twentieth century. The transition from orality to literacy and beyond also has a profound effect on the protagonists' conceptualization of home and nation. The work of a number of media theorists, including Benedict Anderson, Roland Barthes, Walter Benjamin, Stanley Cavell, Ronald Deibert, and Walter Ong, provide the basis for an analytical framework in which to locate these works. David Williams' criticism of media influences in a number of Canadian works opens a space for the discussion of how these theorists address the ontological complexities of the interweaving of media and narrative. This reading of the two novels contends that, although Diviners (1974) is earlier than Mischief (1999) in terms of publication, it is actually Laurence's novel that takes the more postmodern approach in its hybridity of form, as well as its social content. while Alexander, wittingly or not, is implicated in ""museumizing"" his oral Gaelic culture by committing it to print, Morag moves through oral tales to photography and into a far more fluid ""past-present"" that is well served by her innovative ""Memorybank Movies."" Moreover, the multimedia techniques that characterize Morag's narrative anticipate hypertext and create an epistemology of a plural, hybrid nation that leaves a living legacy for Morag's Metis daughter Pique and affirms a plural, overlapping collage of identities that is truly representative of Canada's multicultural nature.",,,English,CULL|REVIEW

English Catholics faced legal sanctions, social isolation, and physical harm for practicing their faith, and the Catholic church began a campaign to maintain, educate, and minister to the community covertly through the use of Jesuit missionaries and published pedagogical texts. The influence of such experiences can be seen in the literary works of John Donne, Robert Southwell, Richard Crashaw, and Elizabeth Cary, as well as in the instructional works by lesser-known Catholic writers including John Fowler, Thomas Wright, John Bucke, Henry Garnet, Gaspar Loarte, John Mush, Jeanne de Cambray, and Agnes More. These texts also show a stylistic influence upon one another wherein pedagogical texts utilize poetic language, and poetic texts instruct the reader in religious practice through modeling and example. Through a careful reading of these works, I examine the early modern literary landscape of England in its Catholic context.

The longevity and success of his tenure is an exemplary case of effective leadership and provided significant insight into what constitutes effective school leadership. The target population for this case study consisted of the school’s 7 administrators, 90 faculty members, 10 English-speaking staff members, and 3 key informants. Data were collected using Bolman and Deal’s (1997) Leadership Orientation Survey along with the Jesuit Secondary Education Administration’s (1994) Administrative Leadership Profile Survey (ALPS). Data collected from the surveys were analyzed using the SPSS, version 10. The study also included data collected from focus interviews with Fr. García and six other significant members of the school community. The interviews were approximately 1–hour individual interviews that employed a semi-structured guide. A concurrent triangulation method was used that directly compared the results from these data collection methods. This was done by looking at the data as a whole and in parts. The parts were internal (faculty, administrators, and staff) and external (parents, alumni, and the superior of the Jesuit community) sectors. The comparison of the findings was then examined in terms of each research question. Analysis of the data revealed that while Fr. García’s predominant leadership style reflected the typical Bolman and Deal characteristics associated with the political frame, his leadership demonstrates access to all four frames. Research has found a correlation between multiple frame use and successful leadership. Relatedly, Fr. García’s capacity to approach his administration from various perspectives is indicative of success. In addition, from the perspective of Jesuit education, an analysis of Fr. García’s leadership indicated recurring themes that contributed to the school’s organizational health. The results of this study provide an extensive analysis of the administration of a unique leader. An analysis of Fr. García’s leadership style from two perspectives gives fresh insight into sustained and successful leadership.","|Academic Department:  Educational Administration and Supervision|Advisor:  Cistone, Peter J.",,English,KEEP|REVIEW

One way to confront the dangers of loosing old privileges is through the redefinition and revival of old codes of conduct and behavior that in the past set them apart from the rest. In the process, old heroes considered instrumental in establishing and shaping their power are retrieved and glorified, and their heroic deeds offered as examples to emulate in the present. During the XVII Century, and in analogous circumstances, the Spanish Baroque writer Baltasar Gracián observes with trepidation the rapid changes in his own society, the breaking down of the social and political order of Imperial Spain. To protect his interests as member of the hegemonic group: —male, Catholic, noble and scholar—, he looks back in history and constructs heroic paradigms utilizing old heroes whose values embody his own. Since the heroic figures incarnate the ideals of the elite, there are neither heroes nor heroism outside the hegemonic class. This dissertation studies three texts by Baltasar Gracián (1601–1658): El Héroe (1637), El Discreto (1646), and El Criticón (Part I, 1651, Part II, 1653, Part III, 1657), that are centered on the heroic male, analyzing changes in the consecutive male heroic prototypes in light of the author's social and historical experience. Gracián's evolving heroic models respond to transformations in the hegemonic position of the Spanish state, moving from profuse optimism and idealism in his first text to disillusion and abandonment in the last one. The Jesuit's work is a crucible in which he tests Occidental values and heroics over his lifetime, adapting each heroic prescription to satisfy the political, historical, social and religious necessities of his present. Although Gracián's heroic formula changes over time, the connecting thread remains: the blood nobility of Castile/Aragón will save the hegemony of the nation. This elitism verbalizes a reactionary anachronism that negates the heroic essence, which is to act in the world on behalf of others. Gracián's texts are progressive, specular images of the author and his society. In all cases, the heroic figure functions as metonym of the Empire in which the strength of the hero confirms the power of the State.","|Academic Department:  Romance Languages and Literature|Advisor:  Rhodes, Elizabeth",,Spanish,CULL|REVIEW

L’analyse du corpus de l’artiste suggère que ce dernier participe à la diffusion de récits mythologiques propres à l’Amérique: à cet effet, la comparaison des œuvres de Légaré aux séries de tableaux du peintre états-unien Thomas Cole (1801–1848) souligne la présence d’une structure cyclique similaire, inspirée des mythologies européennes, mais dans laquelle sont réactualisées de nouvelles données (territoriales, socioculturelles, politiques) proposées par le continent américain. Ainsi, la production de Légaré s’ordonne en fonction d’un archémythe principal, celui de la régénérescence de la nation, et de mythes fondateurs qui retracent les débuts de l’histoire coloniale, alors que se côtoyaient l’Amérindien et le missionnaire jésuite. Tandis que le premier, par association symbolique, devient une figure de rhétorique prédominante dans le discours identitaire tenu par l’artiste, le second y est plutôt célébré pour sa résistance à l’Autre et son courage. À ce chapitre, cette étude démontre l’existence d’une filiation effectuée par l’artiste entre les Canadiens français, les communautés autochtones et les martyrs jésuites, laquelle repose sur le destin tragique qui leur est respectivement associé et le statut de victime qu’ils endossent. Ainsi, la mythologie nationale véhiculée dans les œuvres de Légaré s’articule autour de mythes dépresseurs, axés sur l’idée d’une nation vaincue, mais qui, par la prise en charge de sa mémoire collective, pourra un jour renaître de ses cendres.| |The purpose of this study is to integrate the historical paintings of French Canadian painter Joseph Légaré (1795–1855) into an American tradition of pictorial representation. The analysis of the artist’s corpus suggests that he participates in the diffusion of American mythological narratives. Indeed, the comparison between the paintings of Légaré and those of the American painter Thomas Cole (1801–1848) underlines the presence of a similar cyclic structure, inspired by European myths, but in which are updated new territorial, cultural and political data specific to the American continent. From this perspective, the artistic production of Légaré organizes itself according to a main “archémythe”, one of national renewal, and some founding myths, which redraw the beginnings of colonial history, where the Amerindian and the Jesuit missionary predominated. The Indian, by symbolic association, becomes a rhetorical figure in the discourse of national identity formulated by the artist, whereas the Jesuit martyr is rather celebrated for his resistance and his courage in front of the other. In this regard, this study demonstrates the existence of an association made by the painter between French Canadians, Native people and Jesuit martyrs, which is based on the tragic fate that is associated with each group and the status of victim that they had to assume. Consequently, the national mythology represented in the works of Légaré is structured around depressant myths, based on the idea of a defeated nation, but which, by the creation of a collective memory, can, one day, rise from the ashes.","|Academic Department:  Art History|Advisor:  Vigneault, Louise",,French,CULL|REVIEW

Operative among these contemporary theologians' assumptions, though, is the notion that classical theism is ""perfect being theology"" and vice versa thereby conflating perfect being theology with aspects of the Christian tradition. Implicit within perfect being theology is a scientific methodology that reduces reality to only empirically verifiable facts.|But perhaps these theologians are ignoring important resources for resolving the dilemma--namely God's beauty. How might the peculiar beauty of the cross, then, understood in terms of God's theodrama--the economic Trinity as summary of the Gospel-- rather than as a perfect being address some of the concerns of relational theism? By critically appropriating Hans Urs von Balthasar's focus on Jesus Christ as the distinct speaking and doing form ( Gestalt ) of God's beauty, a form of divine communicative action, it is my contention that God's beauty is the fittingness seen in the incarnate Son's actions to the Father's will that radiates God's glory and enraptures properly perceiving subjects, transforming the imagination through the shaping power of the Spirit and drawing them to participate in God's drama of redemption.|I establish this thesis by conceptually expanding upon a relevant biblical motif found in the theological patterning of the Suffering Servant in Jeremiah and its connection with wisdom, linking it with a theological interpretation of Col 1–2:5. In doing so, God's actions in Christ's redemptive-creative suffering and glorious resurrection become necessary to defining God's beauty as the perfect attunement or fittingness of the incarnate Son's actions in the Spirit to the Father's will. Consequently, God's beauty requires action, imploring believers to imaginatively participate in God's theodrama. In resurrecting the imagination, I suggest that the imagination is transformed by participating in the beauty of God's trinitarian life revealed by the Spirit in incarnate Beauty (2 Cor 3:18). As such, we manifest fitting performances in the dramatic theater of God's glory.","|Advisor:  Vanhoozer, Kevin J.",,English,CULL|REVIEW

Son objectif est de réviser la conception actuelle de l'historiographie du cinéma en France de 1896 jusqu'au début des années 1950 en remettant en question la vision homogène du courant historique de l'histoire traditionnelle du cinéma telle que l'ont présentée les tenants de la nouvelle histoire du cinéma. Cette thèse se divise en trois parties. J'expose dans la première mon cadre et mon principal outil d'analyse. Je présente l'opération historiographique telle que définie par Michel de Certeau, soit comme le croisement dun lieu social marqué par des cadres intellectuels dominants, dun ensemble de procédures dont l'historien se sert pour sélectionner ses sources et construire les faits, et enfin, dune écriture qui implique l'élaboration dun système de relations entre les différents faits construits.

L'objectif des nouveaux historiens n'est pas dexhumer la pluralité des écritures de l'histoire du cinéma, mais plutôt de mettre en évidence la rupture quils opèrent au sein de l'historiographie du cin.||This thesis is one of several recent works to re-evaluate the history of film studies. Its goal is to revise the present-day conception of film historiography in France from 1896 to the early 1950s by calling into question the view of traditional film history as homogeneous portrayed by the new film historians. This thesis is divided into three sections. In the first, I describe my tools and analytical framework. I discuss the historiographical operation as it defined by Michel de Certeau, as the three-way encounter of a social space marked by dominant intellectual frameworks, a range of procedures used by historians to select their sources and construct events, and, finally, the writing of history, which involves creating a system of relations between the various events so constructed. I then describe historical currents in France from the 1870s to the early 1950s. This survey enables me to better identify the exchanges, borrowings and enrichments that occurred during this period between history and film history. In the second part, I “construct” from within a vast range of discourses – those of film historians, cultural historians and film theorists – the dominant conception of film historiography. I show that it is created by product of those who are known by many commentators as the new film historians and that it is reduced as the succession of two great historical currents: traditional film history and new film history. I then discuss how this periodisation has been instrumentalised by those who created it. The goal of the new historians is not to bring to light the plurality of writings on film history, but rather to show the break that they have brought about in film historiography. Finally, a discussion of the role accorded to the mode of film exhibition known as Hale’s Tours in general film histories published before and after the Brighton Congress enables me to soften the break between these two historical currents.

It includes a brief analysis of how high school faculty and administrators can work collaboratively with parents in fostering the moral formation of youth. This study is significant and unique in four ways. First, no other research study offers a fully-developed character education approach and framework for Christian, Catholic religious education. Second, this study highlights what is often left out of the field of Religious Educationnamely the moral formation of our students. Third, the contemporary character education movement focuses primarily on public elementary and middle school education. This study looks at character formation as it occurs in secondary schooling. Most significantly, this study brings the best elements of character education to Jesuit pedagogy, and outlines an approach for cultivating character in Jesuit high schools as part of a comprehensive approach to Catholic religious education. This study is a humanistic, and in particular a Christian humanistic, and historical study that is informed by contemporary scholarship in history, theology, ethics, education and religious education. It provides an overview of the relevant literature on character and character education, with interpretation, analysis, and a critique from a religious educational perspective. The study also provides an overview of the history of character education in Christian religious education. It demonstrates that while academic excellence is an important goal for Jesuit secondary schools, greater attention can and should be focused, in accord with the principles of Jesuit education, on the development of character in order to produce well-rounded persons.","|Academic Department:  Education|Advisor:  Horell, Harold",,English,KEEP|REVIEW

The essence underlying a large body of his poetry was his Catholic religion. His early religious poetry utilized nature-based metaphors to express his love of Christ and trace the immanence of God within nature. He borrowed heavily from the aesthetics of Pater and the philosophy of Duns Scotus. The dissertation explores these early influences and assesses their contribution to the formation of a unique religious interpretation of life and the formulation of an aesthetic congruent with this religion. The dissertation dissects early symptoms of religious doubt within his poetry and finally analyses his ""Terrible Sonnet"" phase in detail to ascertain whether the crisis so often described as occurring during this period was religious or merely reflected a loss of creative ability.","|Academic Department:  English|Advisor:  Prozesky, Stella",,English,CULL|REVIEW

It argues that the contemplative works of Ignatius of Loyola and Teresa of Avila support a reading of Christ's death and resurrection as an allegory of the image's awakening in a scenario of damage, and that Catholicism's response to the Protestant rejection of the soteriological efficacy of works rests on the hermeneutic possibilities inscribed in it. The image's awakening is shown to disclose a limit whose overcoming acts as a foundation of the salutary action of institutions, particularly that of religious orders like the Jesuit and the Discalced Carmelite orders. Focusing on the Jesuit construction of the institution as a tool gripped by the hand of God, the first half of the dissertation proposes to think of efficacy in terms of the discovery of an apostolic mandate in the void opened by the image's dissipation. I explore the performance of this dissipation (an echo of Christ's disappearance from the world in the Ascension) in the prescriptions for the election of a new leader laid out in the order's Constitutions and in the schema for the Election that the Spiritual Exercises, Ignatius' manual of contemplation, lodge at their core. The second half, an extended reading of The Interior Castle, juxtaposes the Jesuit performance of this dissipation with Teresa's efforts to secure the image's persistence. The delay that afflicts the image's dissipation, as well as the passage to efficacy, is referred to Teresa's statements on the ""inconvenience"" of Christ's disappearance, and then linked to the growing relevance of the category of beauty in the praxis of the Discalced Carmelite order. Shifting the focus away from the iconoclastic polemic, The Theurgic Image considers the relation between image and institution to revolve around the possibility of a praxis which, resisting the autonomization of action implicit in the Protestant doctrine of sola fide, would be endowed with a transcendental foundation. In its movement towards a consideration of beauty, it argues for the problematization of this praxis and of the institutions that embody it as the site of a prophetic articulation of the distinctly modern differentiation between technics and art.","|Academic Department:  Spanish and Portuguese Language and Literatures|Advisor:  Dopico-Black, Georgina",,English,KEEP|REVIEW

Specifically, I argue that the Catholic sacramental imagination holds the potential to enact a public counter-narrative to the legal, rhetorical, and ideological structures that both legitimize and conceal the reality of institutionalized torture. I approach this task by examining the roots of the Catholic moral imagination in the sacramental traditions of the church's faith regarding the life, suffering, death, and resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth, and by arguing that this tradition necessarily implies certain ethical and theological claims (articulated in Catholic social teaching) regarding the inviolable dignity of the human person. Central to my study is the conviction that a theological response to torture is effective only insofar as it confronts, resists, and de-legitimizes the idolatrous pretensions of American empire. My point of departure lies primarily in the resources and warrants of my own faith tradition, notably a post-Vatican II sacramental theology. The basis of my argument lies in the claim that Catholic sacramentality is intrinsically ethical because it is rooted in the Paschal Mystery, which is historically and irrevocably linked to the commitment to justice for all who have suffered and died at the hand of empire. At the same time, I argue that this tradition, and the moral imagination it generates, contribute valuable resources to the task of forging a broader public consensus against torture and indefinite detention as legal responses to the global war on terror."" I approach the notion of a ""Catholic moral imagination"" as a response to torture in terms of an ideal yet to be fully realized. At the same time, I draw upon existing cultural and symbolic structures within the tradition which I argue are capable of eliciting moral outrage and effective political resistance to torture. These resources include a broadly sacramental and communal worldview, an estimable body of social thought whose cornerstone is the inviolable dignity of the human person, and a rich historical tradition of prophetic social engagement. The dissertation does not attempt a comprehensive sacramental or liturgical theology. Instead, it considers, in some depth, the sacramental dimensions of a broader alternative social imagination, one which seeks to counter our national amnesia around U.S. involvement in torture, to resist official narratives regarding the necessity and moral justification of torture, and to foster a different way of ""imagining"" our perceived enemies.""--Abstract, leaves i-ii.","|Advisor:  Lassalle-Klein, Robert",,English,CULL|REVIEW

The purpose of the dissertation is to describe the doctrines of the knowledge of God and the Trinity as articulated by Gregory of Nazianzus, the Eastern father who defined these doctrines for the Eastern tradition, for the purpose of critically evaluating the contemporary models that seek to find their historical precedent in the Cappadocians.|The first two chapters demonstrate Gregory's doctrines of the knowledge of God and the Trinity in order to demonstrate how his numerous confessions all relate to and modify one another. Gregory's doctrine of God was based upon God's nature being infinite and only known through his actions and names. Gregory's doctrine of the Trinity is multifaceted so that he uses a number of grammars to defend the unity and the three persons. Chapter four compares Augustine's On The Trinity to Gregory's grammars to provide a concrete comparison between the two traditions to demonstrate that the typical paradigm that contrasts the East and West is oversimplified and wrong.|The contemporary models will then be analyzed in light of Gregory's grammars and model in order to demonstrate that they have introduced concepts and grammars that are contrary to that of Gregory. The contemporary theologians analyzed include Karl Rahner, Cornelius Plantinga, Bruce Ware, and Thom McCall. The contemporary models are wrong to claim Gregory as their historical precedent because they fail to meet the most basic standards of Orthodoxy as presented by Gregory. One of the main problems in the contemporary treatment of Gregory is that his doctrine is oversimplified so that one aspect or grammar is emphasized and the others are ignored. There is confusion over the proper relationship between the economic and immanent Trinities. There is also a number of problems in how the terms one, unity, essence, and person have been redefined by the contemporary models when compared to Gregory's doctrine. The final argument is that the contemporary models fail to provide the necessary grammars and confessions that safeguard the doctrine of the Trinity and promote worship when compared to Gregory.","|Advisor:  Wellum, Stephen",,English,CULL|REVIEW

The painting is punctuated by numerous city markers, with the largest indicating the city of Rome. On the other screen, twenty-eight cities of the world and Christian and Muslim kings in ceremonial attire on horseback are depicted. This pair of screens was probably produced in the early seventeenth century. It was most likely painted by Jesuit-trained Japanese painters who had learned western themes and painting techniques: perspective and chiaroscuro. Until the sixteenth century, Japanese experience with and knowledge of the world was limited to its neighbouring lands, such as China, Korea, and India. Beyond the realm of Japan lay worlds formed through fascination and the imagination. In 1543, however, this changed with the appearance of the Portuguese, who journeyed to Japan in the pursuit of new lands to develop trade and to spread Christianity. The Portuguese and their culture had a strong impact on Japanese thoughts and activities, including the creation of many screens with European motifs and new views of the world at large. This pair of screens was drawn upon Dutch prototype made by Petrus Kaerius (1571–1646) in 1609. In my thesis I will examine how ""World-Map-and-Twenty-Eight-City"" screens performed a two-fold function. I will first examine how the screens marked Jesuit propagation of Christianity in Japan, and second I will examine how the screens articulated what might be called an emergent sense of Japanese collective identity. By this I do not mean identity based on nationalism, which emerged in Japan only in the nineteenth century. Rather, I mean an increasing awareness of the Self in relation to Other, and not only in relation to those outside the geographic confines of Japan but also within. What I intend to explore is how definitions of geography and culture in world map screens, and specifically ""World-Map-and-Twenty-Eight-City"" screens, prompted viewers to acknowledge a more distinctive Self. The end of the sixteenth and the beginning of the seventeenth centuries was a transitional moment for both the Jesuits and Portugal. Religiously, the Jesuits were in conflict with the Japanese government and, as well their authority was undermined by Mendicants from the Philippines. These conflicts were compounded further by the spread of Protestantism in Europe. Similarly, after a short prosperous trade in Asia, rising economic and political power of the Netherlands and England gradually pushed Portuguese trade out of Asia. By comparing ""World-Map-and-Twenty-Eight-City"" screens with ""In-and-Around- Kyoto"" screens, I argued that the Jesuit's hidden agenda of glorifying Christendom and God's order on earth emerged. Moreover, by comparing this pair with ""Four-Continent-and- Forty-Eight-People"" screens, I detect the emergence of sense of a Japanese Self, that was forged in relation to the Europeans. Although the screens give the impression of the orderly and peaceful world, they mask the unstable situation which the Jesuits and Portugal were experiencing at the time. In the end, I propose that ""World-Map-and-Twenty-Eight-City"" screens transformed and reworked the Dutch prototype from a geographical mode to one that is highly decorative. Rather than articulating a Japanese view of the world, the screens maintained the notion of a powerful Catholic world.","|Academic Department:  Fine Arts|Advisor:  Motsumoto, Moritaka|San Juan, Rose Marie",,English,KEEP|REVIEW

I focus upon plays that reinterpret the Biblical Parable of the Prodigal Son to argue that the Society of Jesus utilized the stage to acquire religious authority over the domestic sphere and to promote paradigms of masculinity that would halt imperial decline. Chapter One sets forth a theoretical framework for this discussion by employing performance theory to establish that theatrical productions often dialogue with the social issues of their day. It reviews the historical context of Jesuit theater to assert that these plays emphasized the benefits of sincere religious devotion, a goal important to the Society and to Tridentine Catholicism. The second chapter examines the prodigal figure's journey in Pedro Pablo de Acevedo's Comedia Caropo (Seville, 1565) and Comedia Filauto (Seville, 1565), Juan de Cigorondo's Tragedia intitulada Oçio (Puebla, 1586), and Pedro de Salas's Coloquio de la Escolástica triunfante y la nueva Babilonia (Soria, 1611). These plays characterize this journey as a spatialized rejection of virtuous paternal authority, after which the prodigals are adrift in a morally contested social sphere. The representation of public space as morally dangerous communicates a need for youth to obey pious elders. Onstage, this includes obedience to a counselor figure who mediates the son's return home. In Chapter Three, I argue that the counselor's performed moral superiority works to legitimate the Society's religious authority over the domestic sphere. Chapters Three and Four then explore the corrective advice offered by counselor figures as they mediate the prodigals' repentance. I conclude that Acevedo's plays encourage noble youth to steward their patrimonies well by guarding them from lower-class parasites. Cigorondo's work addresses the historical concern for idle Creole youth by depicting diligent study and economic productivity as requisites of male virtue in colonial New Spain. In Castile, Salas's work critiques the decadence associated with Philip III's court and posits membership in the Society of Jesus as a fulfilling alternative for youth seeking to realize a virtuous masculinity. By interrogating the construction of religious virtue in these distinct texts, I ascertained that this group of plays reworks the Parable of the Prodigal Son in order to address the immediate concerns of the Society of Jesus. Through the counselor figure these works strive to acquire clerical authority over the domestic sphere, and through the corrective advice offered to prodigal figures these plays seek to shape male behavior in a way that will advance the interests of both Church and Empire.",|Academic Department:  Romance Languages and Literatures,,English,KEEP|REVIEW

As missionaries and prolific authors, the Jesuits were crucial to the expansion and representation of the frontiers of New Spain; likewise, the Spanish-American mission frontier was essential to Jesuit subjectivity as a space of meaningful action where the missionary could perform the ideal of ascetic conduct preserved in Christian tradition. Through the performance of this ideal and the production of missionary narratives and natural histories, the Jesuits bridged the ascetic ideal and the inner-worldly exercise of self-discipline and social control that is central to theories of modernity. The idealized representation of the Jesuit subject's conduct not only reaffirmed the order's corporate identity but also actualized a political and cultural hegemony through narratives that served as a medium for establishing value orientations in all strata of Novohispanic society. Originating in the Society's tradition of ""Edifying Letters,"" eighteenth-century Jesuit narratives increasingly turned towards more detailed accounts of individual subjects' lives and reiterated a common narrative structure covering their early childhood, education within the order, work as teachers and finally the fulfillment of their apostolic vocation on the frontier. This phenomenon is observable in the boom of Jesuit-authored missionary hagiographies appearing in New Spain from 1725 until the expulsion of the order in 1767, coinciding with the Society's most embattled period in both New Spain and Europe. The proliferation of works representing individual missionaries' ""vidas y virtudes"" was accompanied by the differentiation of missionary biography from Jesuit-authored natural histories, which increasingly focused on a secular European reading public. Nevertheless, both genres reflect the enactment of the Jesuit ascetic ideal in distinct value spheres of colonial and European modernity: while the biography of the exemplary missionary responded to the imperatives of social control and the ethical rationalization of the colonial order, Jesuit natural history presupposed an ascetic subject that increasingly pursued knowledge of the natural world as an end in itself.",,,English,KEEP|REVIEW

F., 1904–1984","This study examines how Bernard Lonergan's philosophy of education can provide a fuller understanding of the role of critical thinking in teaching religion in Catholic high schools. It offers a philosophical rationale for the incorporation of critical thinking into the Catholic high school religion classroom and it suggests a pedagogical model for that incorporation, using Lonergan's educational model of theological studies found in Method in Theology. The study employs a philosophical methodology to demonstrate the need for developing adolescents' critical thinking capacities in the context of teaching religion in order to help them grow as authentic knowing and valuing subjects. It not only highlights the importance of promoting adolescents' religious literacy in the texts, creeds, practices, and symbols of the Catholic sacred tradition; but also, it emphasizes the need to cultivate students' religious articulacy, which allows them to give more critically nuanced, articulate form to their own religious questions, understandings, values, and beliefs. The study argues that cultivating such articulacy is best done through dialectical and dialogic discourse in the religion classroom, inviting students to become active participants in the ongoing conversation of the Catholic intellectual tradition. The study shows how Lonergan's eightfold division of the functional specialties of theology into two dynamic movements, downward as the ""mediated"" phase of theology and upward as the ""mediating"" phase of theology, can be used to create such dialectical conversations in the religion classroom in order to foster students' authentic knowing and valuing.

Prior to the 1630s, members of the community struggled with persecution or, if fortunate, benign neglect. The 1630s, however, marked a noticeable shift in how this community was treated by the Stuart court. A group of English Catholics responded to the changing atmosphere, hoping for toleration and even reunion. These individuals, including Franciscus ‡ Sancta Clara, Thomas White, Henry Holden, Serenus Cressy, and John Austin, attempted to re-create an English Catholic identity. English Catholics had long been stigmatized because of the radicalism of the Jesuits, particularly in the Protestant imagination. Jesuits were considered to be ultramontanists, uncompromising doctrinaires, and fifth columnists who were constantly working to undermine the state. In constructing an identity that was rooted in the rhetoric of moderation, moderate Catholics contended that these Protestant concerns were stylized and misperceived. They attempted to resolve the inconsistencies associated with their two seemingly incompatible identities, English and Catholic, suggesting that this conciliation now warranted toleration. They thus attempted to ""un-Jesuit"" the Catholic image by establishing a religious and political common ground with the Protestant majority. To do so, they proclaimed allegiance at first to the monarchy and later to the commonwealth, appeared willing to modify Catholic teachings, and attempted to weaken their ties with the papacy, always prioritizing the common good; they essentially portrayed themselves firstly as good English subjects and secondly as Catholics. Often opportunistic and occasionally adopting dubious theological stances, they capitalized on shifting political moments to secure their lives and properties, to live free of religious persecution, and to acquire power and liberty over their consciences.","|Academic Department:  History|Advisor:  Todd, Margo",,English,KEEP|REVIEW

F., 1904–1984","Religious diversity has become a central topic in the philosophy of religion. This study proposes a methodological approach to the topic by exploring the division of tasks set out by Bernard Lonergan (1904–1984). Lonergan's methodological framework, which he called functional specialization, provides a generic differentiation of tasks, each of which is central to the overall project of understanding religious diversity. This thesis explores the relevance and utility of functional specialization as a methodological approach to religious diversity in the philosophy of religion. The first chapter is an analysis of the literature on religious diversity as a topic in the philosophy of religion. It unearths the dominant concerns in the field and some of the obstacles which continue to hinder the development of this enquiry. The second chapter provides the epistemological grounds of functional specialization. While the division of tasks outlined by Lonergan's methodology is useful simply insofar as it differentiates the tasks of academic enquiry, there are more theoretical grounds by which this division is justified. The third chapter provides an explanatory account of the operations and tasks involved in each of the eight functional specialties. It elucidates these specialties by drawing upon relevant analogies from outside the field of religious studies. The fourth chapter brings together the two main concerns of the study by suggesting ways in which functional specialization can make a methodological contribution to the enquiry into religious diversity. It organizes the distinct but related tasks which constitute the philosophical study of religious diversity, demonstrates the current trends regarding each of these tasks, and suggests ways in which they can be made more effective. Lonergan's notion of functional specialization makes an important contribution to the philosophical debate over religious diversity in significant ways. It provides an effective methodology which delineates both the fundamental tasks of scholarly enquiry and the operations involved in these tasks. It explains how current work in the philosophy of religious diversity could benefit from a clear delineation of the relevant tasks. It provides a framework which is open to collaboration among scholars of diverse philosophical and theological viewpoints.",|Academic Department:  Philosophy of Religion,,English,CULL|REVIEW

This surge on growth of the city poses questions about the quality of its future public and private spaces and its patterns of growth. In the face of these questions the thesis briefly navigates the political and economic landscape of Toronto and its most common practices of city making in search for alternatives. It proposes a new type of urbanism that is driven by ordinary people. This urbanism allows for building a city that is more reflective of the multitude and complex sum of the urban population of Toronto and is more compatible with the rapid cycles of economy, new paradigms in culture and the unforeseen conditions of growth. Tactical Urbanism, as a response to aforementioned conditions, uses tactics to influence the long term planning, rearrange power in the field of action and make use of limited resources. According to Michel de Certeau, tactic is the ruse of players in a field that is dominated by others. In this case the field is the city, the objective is building public and shared spaces and the City and developers are the dominant players. In this thesis four separate projects, that were developed and undertaken between June 2012 and October 2013 in Toronto by the author and in collaboration, are presented as experiments for examining the effectiveness, techniques and possibilities within Tactical Urbanism. Developed mostly based on the concept of détournement (diversion), borrowed from the Situationist International, two streams of experiment are developed: one that is defined by temporary appropriation of space and the other by narrating the city through dynamic and ludic space of walking. Both of these streams of action are concerned with the personal relationship of people and places and focus on fostering a sense of belonging and ownership over the urban built environment.",,,English,CULL|REVIEW

But what does this mean for freedom, and what does this mean for moral responsibility? In this thesis we will examine the grounds of moral responsibility in Lonergan's early works on Thomas Aquinas' theory of operative grace. This issue is of fundamental importance to ethics, as it will determine the nature of our ability to act morally, and our limitations. Therefore through this thesis we will see that Lonergan's early works on operative grace are also of fundamental importance to ethics. We will begin with the Pelagian controversy, where the question first emerged. Then we will examine Lonergan's philosophical and methodological assumptions as he began his ""apprenticeship"" to Aquinas. And finally, we will examine the actual content of Lonergan's presentation. What will become evident is that this is a complex question; in fact, it pushes human reason to its limits. Ultimately, it may only be able to be resolved by taking a stand on the nature of the universe, a stand similar to the one in physics, in which one accepts the worldview of classical or quantum physics.",|Academic Department:  Theological Studies,,English,CULL|REVIEW

But at the end of his intellectual itinerary, it reserves this concept the only religious belief. This raises the question of what becomes of the natural knowledge which previously constituted the transcendental condition of faith. A chronological study of the work of Bouillard reveals a significant displacement in his way of showing the rationality of faith. If it is initially seconded to the method of immanence Blondel to explain the ""logic of faith"", he seeks henceforth this logic by referring to the hermeneutic circle of belief and understanding in line with Saint Anselm. Door by the movement of the understanding of the faith, and initiating a dialogue with religion in general and agnostic philosophy of Eric Weil, it leads to establish a unique relationship between revelation and existence, which operates at three levels: experience of transcendence, religious experience and theological experience of faith. If the author seeks to demonstrate and rooting faith in human experience regarded in its entirety, this experience has also conditions his eyes access to the intelligence of faith and is a set of conditions of possibility of faith. Such change results in fact his tireless dialogue with surrounding culture increasingly secularized and marked by the presence of multiple religions.

Considering selected fiction of the period in relation to changing urban contexts in London and drawing on urban studies and psychoanalytic frameworks, I argue that the metropolis and its inhabitants were subject to continuing transformations and a recurring process of abjection through the prevalence and effects of filth, moral degradation, poverty and death in the midand late nineteenth century. Abjection lurks in the everyday life of the Victorians as imagined in the literary works of Charles Dickens, George Gissing and Arthur Morrison, in realistic and often pessimistic ways, and it lingers in the spaces and new urban subjects of modernity. My thesis is divided into four chapters, addressing broad thematic and conceptual terms, helpful in understanding the Dickens, Gissing and Morrison's depictions of the city: filth and poverty, boundaries, ruins, and abject bodies. I focus on the period 1840–1890s to frame my argument, as this historical sweep allows us to see a range of increasing and shifting concerns about sanitation, overcrowding, slums and transgressing social boundaries, as represented in urban literature of the period. The fiction gets imagined, in part, through these on-going transformations. While previous critics writing on these novelists have emphasised some of these concerns, my work seeks to bring a new perspective through analysing the experience of abjection in everyday life in a transforming urban space like London. Each chapter raises specific questions about the ways abjection is registered in everyday life and how it is spatialised in Victorian London. What is the significance of impurity, danger, social class and boundaries in this process? Is the challenge against abjection productive and/or destructive? How does the fiction of Dickens, Gissing and Morrison help us interpret this challenge against the abject and the transformation of space? In examining these questions, I draw upon a range theorists and critics, in particular, Julia Kristeva's theory of abjection and subjectivity, and theories of space and everyday culture by Henri Lefebvre, Michel Foucault, Michel de Certeau, and Ben Highmore in addition to primary material related to the social and cultural history of Victorian London.",,,English,CULL|REVIEW

Moreover, even Roman Catholics who make Ignatian Exercises often are not spontaneously inclined to obey Roman ecclesiastical authority. Neither avoiding the ecclesial dimension nor an authoritarian ‘follow the rules!’ provides spiritual directors with adequate orientation when working with issues at Church frontiers. This dissertation in pastoral theology seeks to navigate a middle position by moving beyond the individualism and the a-historical assumptions of the existing relevant literature.|The dissertation remains close to the Ignatian primary sources, in the awareness that the Ignatian tradition needs to be constantly updated and that the contemporary ecclesial frontiers are not fully foreseen in the canonical texts. The main hypothesis is that a notion is needed of a ‘pilgrim Church’ in space and time, with Christians who are related to one another in a deep and fundamental sense. The minor hypothesis is that the individual needs to be open towards and prepared to learn from the Roman Catholic Church, in order to understand and to be profoundly moved by these exercises, but not necessarily to become a Roman Catholic.|Having presented and discussed various approaches in the writings of twentieth-century and recent thinkers, this thesis puts forward its own ecclesiological position informed by Charles Taylor, Hans-Georg Gadamer and Karl Rahner. The aim is to take Ignatian studies forward by combining relational anthropology, hermeneutics and a sacramental understanding of the Church, and to apply this synthesis to the practice of giving Ignatian Exercises. The final chapter discusses a selection of cases in the light of my ecclesiological position. The synthesis and application claim originality.","|Advisor:  Endean, Philip",,English,KEEP|REVIEW

He wrote several works across different literary genres both in Spanish and Latin, but was best known for his popular works in Spanish: two miscellanies of natural philosophy, Curiosa filosofía (1630) and Oculta filosofía (1633); a catechism, the Práctica del catecismo romano (1640); his ascetical treatises, especially De la diferencia entre lo temporal y eterno (1640); and his ‘advice-books’ to princes and nobles, most notably Causa y remedio de los males públicos (1642).|As a member of the Jesuit Order, Nieremberg wrote these works with the intention to ‘save souls’, this being the main apostolic goal of the Society. While they provide people with knowledge (‘noticia’) – whether doctrinal, natural, spiritual, or political – these works teach readers to view human existence according to its true end: God’s will of salvation. All things of the temporal world are portrayed as a means to that end.|In order to accomplish this goal, Nieremberg incorporates elements from Loyola’s Ejercicios espirituales (1548), the spiritual foundation of the Jesuit Order, and develops a rhetorical strategy which encourages readers to discern the will of God in the world they inhabit. He also develops this rhetoric according to some of the principal literary and artistic conventions of the seventeenth century, and provides an important example of how a prominent Jesuit writer came to express the apostolic and spiritual principles of his Order, but in the language and imagery of Spain’s Siglo de Oro.","|Advisor:  Thompson, Colin P.",,English,KEEP|REVIEW

I craft the answer to this question by studying the Spiritual Exercises of Saint Ignatius of Loyola. I claim an analogy between the central dynamic of the thirty-day retreat, whose guidelines are in the book of the Spiritual Exercises, and four operative principles that ought to constitute the structure of formation programs for Jesuit schools' faculty and staff in the educational tradition, identity and mission of the Society of Jesus. The four operative principles are discernment, desire, diakonia and decision. Formation that aims at training partners in education to share in the common mission of Jesuit schools happens best when these four operative principles inform the curriculum design and when they interplay during the actual process of forming the educators who work in Jesuit schools. Discernment is the under-girding principle because the Society of Jesus is engaged in education to form women and men who can discern, that is to say, who can decide from their in-depth values, convictions and aspirations. Desire is the operative principle of the first movement of the Spiritual Exercises, which corresponds to the first week of the retreat. Diakonia--the Greek word for service--draws upon the second movement of the Exercises, which expands beyond the second week of the retreat into the third and fourth ones. This second movement is unified by the idea of being inspired by Jesus Christ or from ""outside"" of the retreatants. Lastly, decision is the third movement of the Spiritual Exercises. Ignatius invites the exercitants to make a personal choice of a state of life at the core of the second week of the retreat. But decision as operative principle accompanies the retreatants until the end of their thirty-day experience. The doctoral program of the Boston College Institute of Religious Education and Pastoral Ministry is in theology and education. The dissertation is an academic exercise in the field of pastoral or practical theology at the intersection of education, theology and the means of church education inspired by the Spiritual Exercises. Therefore, besides the analogical reading of Ignatius's work, my method consists of putting the aforementioned operative principles in conversation with a select review of literature in the fields of transformative and reflective adult education, developmental psychology, responsible and collaborative leadership, pastoral ministry and educational change.","|Academic Department:  Institute of Religious Education and Pastoral Ministry|Advisor:  Groome, Thomas",,English,KEEP|REVIEW

It does this by translating portions of the earliest (c. 1581) surviving presentation of Christian teachings written in Japanese, Nihon no Katekizumo (""A Catechism for Japan""). The catechism and encounter are analyzed using Michel Foucault's concept of ""episteme."" The introduction of Christianity into Japan, beginning in 1549, was a profound experience for both the Japanese people and the western missionaries. The Jesuit mission represented not only the first significant encounter with ""the West"" for the Japanese people and the first encounter with ""Japan"" for the missionaries, but it was the first significant encounter between a Christian episteme and a Japanese episteme. Nihon no Katekizumo is thought to be the oldest existing explanation of Christian doctrine in Japanese. It includes an informed critique of Japanese Buddhism and appears to have been composed by Jesuit missionaries for training Japanese students to be priests and missionaries in Japan. Analysis of the form and content of Nihon no Katekizumo suggests that the text was intended to persuade Japanese novices of not only the truth of Christian teachings, but also their superiority to Buddhist teachings. It provides criticism of Japanese religious teachings and an explanation of Christian doctrine. The use of many classical Chinese characters and technical Buddhist terms clearly suggests that Nihon no Katekizumo was prepared with an elite, Buddhist audience in mind. By translating and examining extant sections of Nihon no Katekizumo (the preface and the first chapter), this thesis discusses the episteme held by the Jesuit missionaries and how it functioned in their Japanese mission. Further, this thesis investigates how the Jesuits' use of the Japanese language to argue and assert their own episteme necessarily resulted in an encounter with another, Japanese Buddhist episteme, a kind of interaction that Foucault himself did not discuss in his writings.",,,English,KEEP|REVIEW

Dissertation,"Hoffmann, Deborah Lee",2009,"The Spirit of Sound: Prosodic Method in the Poetry of William Blake, W.B. Yeats, and T. S. Eliot",Montreal,McGill University,273,PhD diss.,,,http://digitool.Library.McGill.CA:80/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&object_id=115657,,19th century,Literature -- Poetry -- Prosody,Europe -- UK,"Hopkins, Gerard Manley, 1844–1889","Accompanying materials housed with archival copy. This project focuses on the prosody of three major poets, William Blake, W. B. Yeats, and T. S. Eliot. It explores the relationship between each poet's poetic sound structures and his spiritual aims. The project argues that in Blake's prophetic poems The Four Zoas, Milton, and Jerusalem, in Yeats's middle and late poetry, and in Eliot's post-conversion poetry, the careful structuring of the non-semantic features of language serves to model a process through which one may arrive at the threshold of a spiritual reality. The introductory chapter situates these poets' works within the genre of mystical writing; establishes the epistemological nature of poetic sound and its relationship to mystical expression; considers the historical and personal exigencies that influence each poet's prosodic choices; and outlines the prosodic method by which their poetry is scanned. Chapter one addresses William Blake's efforts to re-vision Milton's Christian epic Paradise Lost by means of a logaoedic prosody intended to move the reader from a rational to a spiritual perception of the self and the world. Chapter two considers the development of W.B. Yeats's contrapuntal prosody as integral to his attempt to make of himself a modern poet and to his antithetical mystical philosophy. Chapter three explores the liminal prosody of T. S. Eliot by which he creates an incantatory movement that points to a spiritual reality behind material reality. The project concludes with a consideration of the spiritual aims of Gerard Manley Hopkins and H.D. (Hilda Doolittle) and posits a revaluation of Hopkins' sprung rhythm and H.D.'s revisionary chain of sound as prosodic practices intrinsic to their spiritual aims.||Ce projet porte sur la prosodie de trois poètes importants, William Blake, W. B. Yeats, et T. S. Eliot, et il explore la relation entre les structures poétiques du son et les buts spirituels de chaque poète. L'argumentaire du projet soutient que dans les poèmes prophétiques de Blake, The Four Zoas, Milton, et Jerusalem, dans la poésie du milieu et de la fin de la carrière de Yeats, et dans la poésie après-conversion d'Eliot la structuration attentive des figures non-sémantiques du langage sert à façonner un processus à travers lequel on pourrait arriver au seuil de la réalité spirituelle. L'introduction sert à situer les oeuvres des trois poètes dans le genre de l'écriture mystique, à établir la nature épistémologique du son poétique et de sa relation à l'expression mystique, à considérer les exigences historiques et personnelles qui ont influencé les choix prosodiques de chaque poète, et à cerner la méthode prosodique selon laquelle on scande leur poésie. Le premier chapitre aborde les efforts de William Blake de revoir l'épopée chrétienne Paradise Lost de Milton selon une prosodie logaédique dont l'intention est de transporter le lecteur d'une perception rationnelle à une perception spirituelle de soi et du monde. Le deuxième chapitre considère le développement de la prosodie en contrepoint de W. B. Yeats comme étant intégral à sa tentative de se construire en tant que poète moderne et à sa philosophie mystique antithétique. Le chapitre trois examine la prosodie liminale de T. S. Eliot avec laquelle il crée un mouvement incantatoire qui indique une réalité spirituelle derrière la réalité matérielle. La conclusion prend en considération les buts spirituels de Gerald Manley Hopkins et H. D. (Hilda Doolittle) afin de postuler une réévaluation du rythme à ressorts d'Hopkins et l'enchaînement révisionnel du son d'H. D. en tant que pratiques prosodiques intrinsèque à leurs buts spirituels.","|Academic Department:  English|Advisor:  Hickman, Miranda Brun",,English,CULL|REVIEW

The disciplines of history and anthropology necessarily inform my work; the former gives it depth and the latter nuance. My research includes reports from council meetings, court hearings, congressional testimony, tribal newsletters, newspaper accounts, fieldnotes, and interviews. From these materials, as well as from my life experiences, I construct a narrative history of the interaction of Euro-Americans and Native Americans who live together in the region of the Western Door of the Haudenosaunee, or Iroquois Confederacy.|The actions of Jesuit priests, the earliest whites who lived among Senecas, foreshadow the actions of those who came later. Thus, many twenty-first century New Yorkers desire that Senecas give up both their culture and their land. To illustrate this I explore in detail major confrontations and analyze the way they have negatively impacted on Seneca culture and the Allegany Seneca land base.|I have chosen the city of Salamanca as my geographical focus in order to reveal the nature of the ongoing interactions between Senecas and Euro-Americans. Salamanca is an anomaly in that it is the only city in the United States that lies almost entirely within the borders of an Indian reservation. The history of how that occurred and why it has continued to affect Senecas and their neighbors is central to my research. I am fortunate that I was raised on the Allegany Territory in Salamanca so that I could receive neighborly help from my many Seneca and Euro-American neighbors, friends, acquaintances, and officials.|Seneca culture, like any culture, changes. Yet, in spite of many military, cultural, and political assaults, Senecas maintain their particularity, their unique ""Seneca-ness"", and their authenticity. This is not always readily apparent to non-Senecas. In this dissertation I will demonstrate that the tropes of decline and assimilation are fallacious and that Seneca culture remains both traditional and vibrant. Familial relations remain surprisingly unchanged, in spite of what many believe. Women have an unbroken record of agency in spite of paternalistic impositions. By agency I mean the ability to control their lives and influence Seneca economic, political, social and other spheres. Many of the values and characteristics of Seneca particularity, such as an unyielding sense of place, have always infused Seneca worldviews. This is not to say that tragedies--such as land and language loss--have not occurred.|Senecas, in spite of the actions of their neighbors, have continued their cultural particularity with humor, dignity and magnanimity. Their culture has changed, sometimes with tragic losses, sometimes with admirable adaptations. Through it all, they remain Seneca. And nowadays, more often than not, the Senecas' neighbors are friends.","|Academic Department:  Anthropology|Advisor:  Tedlock, Barbara|Tedlock, Dennis",,English,KEEP|REVIEW

I consider what effects these preservation projects and the tourists they attract have on communities of living memory, while also engaging non-Western conceptions of heritage and the local processes for how it is preserved or produced in such contexts. To these ends, I look at one of the first non-Western urban sites to be inscribed on the World Heritage list—the Medina of Fez, Morocco. The Medina offers a rich site for this analysis given its complex history as a preservation project, its status as the cultural capital of Morocco, and for a number of other reasons. I ask how preservation practices and protocols, as well as various discourses together construct the Medina as a World Heritage city and through what means is this spatial dynamic sustained. I also examine the effects of this Western driven global place-making and heritage preservation campaign employed within a non-Western place of living memory and memory practices. Through engaging these questions, I offer both a top-down (text-based analysis) and a bottom-up analysis (embodied spatial analysis) that draws from Foucaultian spatial theory, Michel de Certeau's poetics of space, and from literature in rhetorical studies and critical heritage studies. What follows is a three-part discussion of how the World Heritage place-making and preservation practices constitute a preservationist apparatus that renders heterotopic effects, how the heterotopia is grounded and sustained by the pedestrian rhetorics of tourists, local discourse, material preservation. Further, I engage how local meaning-making and memory work in the Medina of Fez offers a different understanding of how heritage is preserved and produced.","|Advisor:  Phillips, Kendall",,English,CULL|REVIEW

This project uncovers liminal protagonists in French urban space, analyzes their Certelian practices, and considers what happens when they interact with urban limits in unexpected or unintended ways. Through the thematic lens of the border, my readings of the spatial practices of urban travelers breathe new life into canonical literary and cinematic texts, chronologically spanning from Louis Aragon's Le Paysan de Paris (1926) to Christian Volckman's Renaissance (2005). Each chapter engages with cultural theorists Michel Serres, Bruno Latour, Michel de Certeau, Régis Debray and intellectual movement sexistentialism, surrealism, posthumanism that all emphasize the importance of borders as specific zones of creative possibilities. Such an approach requires a detailed engagement with French culture and history and offers novel research paths in the field of French studies. At the same time, this study stretches beyond the disciplinary boundaries of French studies, entering into dialogue with spatial theory, urban and borderland studies, and cybernetics. Chapter One focuses on interwar representations of New York in order to establish this projects central terms: (im)mobility and spatial delinquency, two competing forms of urban mobility in Célines's Voyage au bout de la nuit and Paul Morand's New York. Chapter Two initiates a discussion on borderland poetics in Louis Aragon's Le Paysan de Paris and Jean Vigo's L'Atalante, both of which center their narratives on borderlands in and around the nations capital.

F., 1904–1984","The purpose of this dissertation is to demonstrate that Bernard Lonergan's theory of conversion can be applied to the fictional lives of the three main characters in Susan Howatch's novels of the Starbridge series. This will validate Lonergan's theory and provide a comprehensible demonstration of it as well. The rationale of this study is based on two well-established assumptions. The first, articulated by Erich Auerbach in modern literary theory, is that literature mirrors reality; the second, expressed by Paul Ricoeur, among others, is that an author expresses his/her own worldview. Howatch's three main characters, Charles Ashworth, Jonathan Darrow, and Neville Aysgarth, reflect reality because as clergymen in the Church of England, they sin repeatedly, just as every Christian does. Afterward, through a process of redemption, they confront their sin, repent, and then work to put things right. Writing of those who experience conversion, Bernard Lonergan says that ""they have to learn with humility that religious development is dialectical, that the task of repentance and conversion is life-long."" This is precisely the process of conversion that these fictitious characters demonstrate. Susan Howatch herself has written on the ways in which the ""religion"" of an author necessarily seeps into his/her works. In addition, Howatch admits to having been in the throes of a conversion experience as she wrote the Starbridge novels. On many levels, then, these novels represent reality. Thus they provide a suitable vehicle for applying, exploring, and understanding Bernard Lonergan's complicated theory of conversion.","|Academic Department:  English|Advisor:  O'Brien, Maureen R.",,English,CULL|REVIEW

Psalm 118 is the longest psalm consisting of 176 verses, organised into 22 strophes, with eight verses per strophe. The law of God is the subject of this acrostic psalm. The examination is focused on the manner in which Saint Robert Bellarmine delivers his message, in terms of structure, style, language, and the use of sources. In looking at the structural aspects, the relative length of the commentary for the strophes, and the nature of subtitles are scrutinised. In stylistic considerations the overall features and the uses of stylistic devices are examined. In the use of sources we look at how, where, and why Saint Robert Bellarmine uses scriptural quotations, cites other authors, and discusses the Greek and Hebrew equivalents of selected phrases. All instances of use of sources and stylistic devices are listed and commented upon. Comparisons also are made with the methodology of other authors commenting on Psalm 118, namely Saint Augustine, most frequently cited by Saint Robert Bellarmine and Saint Jerome, the author of Gallican Psalter. References are made to the commentary of Callan, a twentieth-century author. To promote better understanding of this work, related matters, such as biographical details about Saint Robert Bellarmine, Saint Augustine and Saint Jerome is also given as well a presentation in the Psalter, its theme, language and liturgical importance. The conclusion focuses on the identity of intended audience and the benefits of studying good Latin texts. Besides greatly benefiting priests and religious who use the Psalter in their daily prayers, the intended audience includes Protestants as well, since Saint Robert Bellarmine demonstrates makes such frequent use of Saint Augustine, who is greatly respected by Protestants. Recommendations are made for promoting Latin literacy and methods of commenting on Latin texts are suggested, which would promote this aim.","|Academic Department:  Classics|Advisor:  Coulson, Frank",,English,CULL|REVIEW

In order to advance the Church's theological development in her search for successful interreligious dialogue with non-Christian religions and their peoples, this dissertation will argue that there is need for the Church to acknowledge that religious pluralism is not only a de facto (matter of fact) social reality but also a de jure (matter of principle) of God's relationship with the people God created. This dissertation will argue that this is an imperative theological assumption, indispensable for truly honest, lasting, respectful, and successful interreligious dialogues with peoples of non-Christian faiths. Dupuis' concept of religious pluralism, which is sensitive not only to the theological reality of God's relationship with human nature but also to the social global reality, needs appropriate media to promote and sustain the desired enduring interreligious and inter-cultural dialogue so needed and indispensable in the world today. This study will thus also propose that the appropriate means to promote such dialogue can be found in a pluralistic media culture that exhibits the dynamics articulated in Walter Ong's concept of ""dialogic openness."" It follows therefore that Ong's notion of a media society characterized by dialogic openness will provide a safe vehicle for promoting more enduring and effective interreligious dialogue based on the model of inclusive religious pluralism of Dupuis. The theological arguments of this study will be based on some relevant historical developments in the theology of universal salvation in the Catholic tradition, especially from papal documents dating from the 19th century through the Second Vatican Council and further into post Vatican II major ecclesial documents. Theological insights of several pluralist theologians will be examined to underscore the fact that Jacques Dupuis' inclusive religious pluralism did not emanate from a vacuum. Walter's Ong's dialogic openness will be examined with emphasis on his advocacy for collaboration of the different media stages of development as well as the different types of media. To accomplish the objective of this study, important parallels between Dupuis' concept of religious pluralism and Ong's notion of dialogic openness through the media in a pluralistic society will be identified. Conclusively, this study will be arguing that if a media society operates on the basis of Ong's dialogic openness, hence establishing the appropriate forums of engagement and dialogic interactions among peoples of diverse religious faith traditions and cultures based on Dupuis' inclusive religious pluralism, there is a greater likelihood for all religions in human society to collaborate effectively toward resolving many common social, economic, environmental, global, and political challenges that confront the human society today.",|Academic Department:  Theology,,English,CULL|REVIEW

Der Mensch lebt und baut sein Leben und seine Existenz auf dem auf, was ihm die Vergangenheit gebracht hat. Gleichzeitig aber schaut der Mensch in die Zukunft und stellt die Frage, was die Zukunft ihm bringt und gibt. Der gläubige Mensch fragt gleichzeitig weiter, was ihm der Glaube für seine Zukunft bringt und was mit seinem Leben aus seiner Zeit in der Ewigkeit werden wird? Die vorliegende Arbeit will auf religionswissenschaftlicher und eschatologischer Basis die Frage nach der gegenseitigen Verankerung von Zeit und Ewigkeit klären. Im eschatologischen Bezug stehen Zeit und Ewigkeit in engem Verhältnis und dadurch findet die Zeit ihr „Größenmaß“. Daher trägt die vorliegende Arbeit den Titel „Zeit als eschatologische Größe“. Dieses Thema wird auf dem schöpferischen Grund ausgearbeitet und durch die biblische Offenbarung mit der Trinität verbunden. Darum lautet die Hauptthese dieser Arbeit: „Christliche Theologie versucht, die menschliche Zeit kairologisch und eschatologisch in die Ewigkeit des trinitarischen Gottes hinein zu verankern“. Diese Hauptthese wird erklärt und ausgelegt in fünf Teilen: Teil I: Zeit – Theorie - Darstellung bedeutsamer biblischer Zeitbegriffe. Sie zeigen: Ehe die Zeit in der Ewigkeit Gottes entgrenzt ist, ist die Ewigkeit unbegrenzte Zeit. Die unbegrenzte Zeit ist nicht leer, sondern zugleich gefüllte und erfüllte Zeit. Teil II: Zeit und Ewigkeit - Vorstellung kosmologisch-theologischer Modelle von Frank J. Tipler und Teilhard de Chardin. Christus als Alpha und Omega – der Anfang und das Ende: im Tod und in der Auferstehung, in der Wirklichkeit der Eucharistie und in der Schöpfung als die Ausdehnung der Evolution. - Verbindung der Zeit mit der Evolution durch philosophische und naturwissenschaftliche Aussagen. Die Evolution basiert auf dem Fundament der Ewigkeit Gottes und der Allgegenwart Gottes. Sie ist Fortsetzung der Schöpfung – creatio continua. Die Evolution bleibt ständig im dynamischen „nunc – jetzt“. - Darstellung der neuen Zeit-Perspektiven, welche die Ewigkeitsvorstellungen des Gregor von Nyssa eröffnen.

The human being lives and bases his life and existence on what the past has brought him. At the same time he looks to the future, and asks the question what the future will bring him. The religious person goes further, and asks what this faith will bring him for the future. And what influence his present life will have in transcendental terms. This paper will clarify the question of the mutual interconnection between Time and Eternity based on religious studies and eschatology. In the eschatological sphere, Time and Eternity stand in a very close relationship, and through this, Time gets its “magnitude”. Consequently, this paper has the title: “ Time as an eschatological Dimension”. This theme will be elaborated, based on Creation and the biblical revelation of the Trinity. The main thesis of this work is: “Christian theology, an attempts to interconnect, kariologically and eschatologically, human Time and the eternal Trinity”. This main thesis will be developed in five sections: Section I: Time – The Theory - Depiction of significant biblical time-concepts which show: Before Time was unbounded from the eternal God, eternity is unbounded Time. The unbounded Time is not an empty Time, but rather a full and fulfilled Time. Section II: Time and Eternity - A cosmological-theological Model as pictured by Frank J. Tipler and Teilhard de Chardin. Christ as Alpha and Omega – the beginning and the end: In Death and in the Resurrection, in the Reality of the Eucharist and in the Creation as an extension of Evolution. - The connection of Time and Evolution trough the evidence of philosophy and science. Evolution based on the foundation of the eternal-God and all-present-God. It is the continuation of the creation – creation continua. Evolution remains dynamically, continuously a “nunc” – “now”. - The depiction of the new Time-perspectives, as imagined and opened up by Gregory von Nyssa. The sharing in Gods eternity is a progressive process. Diastema – Process of Creation. - The time of the Creation finds its foundation in the Trinitarian God through Jesus Christ as Creation ex amore. Section III: Time in the symbolic Interpretation - Solidarity of the symbols in the Time of Eternity. Symbols on the religious level refer to Gods reality in deeply moved and affected people. - Symbols in the sacramental area: Jesus Christ as the Proto-Sacrament and at the same time that sacramental reality in which Time and Eternity are unified. Section IV: Time and Eternity in Eschatology as a Dimension of the Trinitarian God. - The ides of the theological-creation and the salvation-economical Unity of Time and Eternity in the Trinitarian reasoning from Jürgen Moltmann and Wolfhart Pannenberg. Section V: Systematic results to the theology of embedding the human Time in the Trinitarian God on a kairological and eschatological basis. - Jesus Christ, the Kairos as the bridge in Salvation History to the understanding of the Trinitarian reality of Eternity, which lives and is at work in the sacramental Church. - The Loving Community of the Three-in-one-God establishes Time in the Eternity of God. Jesus Christ, true God and true Man is the revelation of the Trinity and at the same time is the interconnection between God and Man. Through his coming into human Time and History, Time finds its dimension through the interconnection with Eternity.","|Academic Department:  Catholic Theology|Advisor:  Meuffels, Otmar",,German,CULL|REVIEW

The task is largely to present from his opus magnum (a triptych encompassing Herrlichkeit, Theodrama and Theologik ) the positions that must be understood if one is to understand the project as a whole, and to present them in the form of deductions from first principles.|Therefore, taking von Balthasar's starting point in the person of Jesus Christ as the metaphysical first principle, the first question is to ask what the relationship between that reality and the created world is. This question is answered in general terms as being one of participation. This general answer is then set in contrast to theologies of identity, in which God and the world are ultimately reducible to one another, a contrast which highlights that the relationship between Christ and the world that von Balthasar wants is one of analogy.|The specific notion of analogy von Balthasar is working with is one that requires a robust place for historicity--accordingly, some time is spent establishing the historical dimensions of the Incarnate Christ. This enables the understanding of analogy as likeness within greater unlikeness to emerge, an understanding which roots the unlikeness in the aseity of God. This in turn grounds a likeness whose strength will be seen in the way that creatures in their being image the Trinity. The theological upshot is a view of the divine activity in which every action of God from Trinitarian procession to final redemption is seen as self-giving, which is understood as the fundamental character of divine love.","|Advisor:  Volf, Miroslav",,English,CULL|REVIEW

Books and articles abound on the Trinity and personhood, the Trinity and ecclesiology, the Trinity and gender, the Trinity and marriage, the Trinity and societal relations, the Trinity and politics, the Trinity and ecology, etc. Recently a number of theologians have suggested that a doctrine of the Trinity may provide the key to a Christian theology of religions. The purpose of this study is to evaluate critically the claim that a proper understanding of ""the Trinity"" provides the basis for a new understanding of religious diversity. |Drawing upon the trinitarian theology of Augustine (principally De Trinitate), I critically examine the trinitarian doctrine in Mark Heim's trinitarian theology of multiple religious ends, Amos Yong's pneumatological theology of religions, Jacques Dupuis' Christian theology of religious pluralism and Raimundo Panikkar's trinitarian account of religious experience (along with Ewert Cousins' efforts to link Panikkar's proposal to the vestige tradition). My Augustinian assessment is structured around three trinitarian issues in the Christian theology of religions: (1) the relationship of the ""immanent"" and the ""economic"" Trinity, (2) the relations among the divine persons (both ad intra and ad extra) and (3) the vestigia trinitatis. |In conversation with Augustine, I argue (1) that there is good reason to question the claim that the ""Trinity"" represents the key to a new understanding of religious diversity, (2) that current ""use"" of trinitarian theology in the Christian theology of religions appears to be having a deleterious effect upon the doctrine, and (3) that the trinitarian problems I document in the theology of religions also encumber attempts to relate trinitarian doctrine to a variety of other contemporary issues including personhood, ecclesiology, society, politics and science. I further argue that contemporary theology is driven by a problematic understanding of what it means for a doctrine of the Trinity to be ""relevant"" and that Augustine challenges us to rethink the ""relevancy"" of trinitarian doctrine.",|Academic Department:  Religion|Advisor:  Geoffrey Wainwright,,English,CULL|REVIEW

Scholars have recognized that a dramatic compositional shift occurred between the second and third settings, but have provided no cogent explanation for the change. Most reasons given revolve around the Council of Trent, which held its final session in 1563. However, a consideration of the history and religious contexts of the works discloses other, possibly better explanations. I propose that the primary influence leading to Lasso's compositional shift was the liturgical reform initiated by his employer, Duke Wilhelm V, and enforced by the Jesuit priest Walram Tumler. These reforms had a profound effect on all facets of worship in Bavaria, most notably music. Recognizing the influence of the Jesuits on Lasso's music makes it possible to understand the composer's dramatic change in style.","|Academic Department:  Music|Advisor:  Wexler, Richard",,English,KEEP|REVIEW

Having grown used to the repeated attacks of nativists upon the fidelity and competency of the German and Irish immigrants flooding the country, Democratic and Catholic newspapers (the latter often run by the Churchs U.S. hierarchy) spilled copious amounts of ink defending the adopted citizens they valued as constituents and congregants. These efforts frequently consisted of arguments proving the Americanness of the recent arrivals, pointing to their hard work, love of liberty, and willingness to sacrifice for their adopted country. However, immigrants sometimes undermined this portrayal (in the eyes of nativists) by prioritizing their ethnic and/or religious identities over their identities as new United States citizens. Even some opportunities seemingly tailor-made for the defenders of Catholicism and the nations adopted citizens could go awry. When the supposedly well-disciplined Irish volunteers from Savannah, Georgia brawled with another Georgia company on a Rio Grande steamboat, the fight threatened to confirm the worst stereotypes of the nations new Irish citizens. In addition, although the Jesuits John McElroy and Anthony Rey gained admirers in the Army and in the rest of the country for their untiring care for wounded and sick soldiers in northern Mexico, anti-Catholic activists denounced them for taking advantage of vulnerable young men to win converts for the Church. Using the letters and personal papers of soldiers, Catholic and Democratic newspapers, military records, and the diaries and correspondence of Fathers John McElroy and Anthony Rey, this study illuminates the lives and actions of Catholic and immigrant volunteers and the debates over their participation in the war. Shedding light on this understudied and misunderstood facet of the war with Mexico, it adds to the scholarship on immigration and religion in antebellum America, illustrating the contentious and controversial process by which immigrants and their supporters tried to carve out a place in U.S. society. Understanding this process aids our comprehension of immigration assimilation and the contested nature of Americanness in the mid-nineteenth century.","|Academic Department:  History|Advisor:  May, Robert E.|Morrison, Michael M.|Cutter, Charles|Pitts, Yvonne M.",,English,KEEP|REVIEW

This study concerns the comparison of the motivations, program strategies, and organization strategies of the internationalization policies of two Jesuit universities: Sophia University in Japan and Georgetown University in the United States. This study focuses on understanding internationalization policies at the two universities and developing a conceptual framework that might be useful in the expansion of scholarship of internationalization theory. There are three key research questions: (a) Is the noticeable shift from social and cultural rationales for internationalization to for-profit rationale ubiquitous?; (b) How do the policies of internationalization of the two universities resonate with the particular contexts surrounding them?; and (c) To what extent do the programs of internationalization reflect the core value of the Jesuit philosophy of education which is to prepare men and women for others? Qualitative comparative case study was conducted at both research sites through semi-structured interviews with senior administrators, deans, faculty, and administrative staff members. On-site materials are collected and analyzed. Cross-case analysis is used to compare and synthesize the findings of the two single case studies. This study found that no noticeable shift from socio-cultural rationale to for-profit rationale has taken place at the two universities. Despite financial constraints, the two universities' internationalization polices are affected most strongly by the socio-cultural rationale and the academic rationale. Sophia puts an emphasis on the motivation for intercultural understanding stemming from its history and origin, while Georgetown gives its highest attention to the motivation for human development. The two universities are able to appropriate their contexts and surroundings so that the universities' idiosyncratic features of local contexts play a significant role in defining their specific responses to the challenges of globalization which are inscribed in their international programs and projects. Finally, the Jesuit philosophy of education, ""men and women for others,"" plays a crucial role as a bedrock on which the direction of internationalization policies is defined. However, despite the strong relationship between the Jesuit philosophy of education and policy, there is only a weak correlation between the philosophy of education and programs. This research will contribute to a wider perspective on internationalization policies through cross-cultural comparative research at an institutional level, an expansion of literature about a global university, and a re-visioning of internationalization for the sake of conscientizing internationalization at an individual level and responsible internationalization at an institutional level.","|Academic Department:  Education Policy, and Leadership|Advisor:  Lin, Jing",,English,KEEP|REVIEW

These two concerns, while distinct, are intimately related and find their practical outworking in the important practice of interreligious dialogue.|Utilizing resources from Martin Luther's theology and the Lutheran confessional writings, this study offers an understanding of the Christian gospel as promise as key to addressing the above mentioned missiological challenges. In its construction of a confessional Lutheran missiology, it critically retrieves and constructively reappropriates four resources from the Lutheran tradition: the gospel as promise, the law/gospel distinction, a theology of grace as promise of mercy fulfilled, and a theology of the cross utilizing the hiddenness of God. The law of God as accusing, yet webbing humanity to its Creator; the gospel as the comforting promise of vulnerable, loving mercy; and the hiddenness of God as elusively mystifying form the overarching framework within which a contemporary Lutheran missiology seeks to engage the religious other by dialectically relating gospel proclamation and dialogue. Such a Lutheran view of ""mission shaped by promise"" constitutes an alternative voice within the contemporary missiological landscape, dominated by an understanding of grace as human nature fulfilled and an approach to the missiological task as identifying traces of divine grace and truth in the midst of interreligious work toward human peace and justice. While humbly receiving the deepest witness of its dialogue partner, such a Lutheran approach boldly offers the paradoxical revelation and hiddenness of God in the cross as a distinctively Christian contribution to an interreligious dialogue centered on the ambiguity and hiddenness of God in daily experience.","|Academic Department:  Theology|Advisor:  Hinze, Bradford",,English,CULL|REVIEW

It is described as the provision of savings, credit and insurance services to low income earners and the very poor in society through Microfinance Institutions (MFI). Additionally, MFI provide vocational training in various skills such as hand crafts, business and language skills. Livelihoods on the other hand constitute the ways in which people access and mobilise resources that enable them to increase their economic security thus reducing the vulnerability created and exacerbated by conflict, and how these resources help them pursue goals necessary for their survival. As a livelihoods strategy for refugees, the services of MFI have mainly been employed in camp settings, with few projects run for urban refugees. Many reasons arise for the difficulty in employing it as a livelihood strategy in urban settings, with the most common being the fluidity and mobility of urban refugees that renders them a risky group to lend money, grants or training to. This study explores the accessibility of microfinance to forced migrants and refugees living in the economic hub of Africa, Johannesburg. The findings suggest that refugees and other forced migrants receiving microfinance heard about the MFI in this particular study- Jesuit Refugee Services (JRS), from their social networks of family and friends while those who had never heard about JRS or any other organization offering microfinance services were in completely different social networks and were of different nationalities from the beneficiaries. As such, the question of accessibility to microfinance is linked to availability of information through social networks. Language also proved to influence the livelihood strategies adapted by the different refugees. Refugees who could speak English and other South African languages were in employment or in trade ventures as they could communicate with host nationals. This is unlike those refugees who only spoke French and Lingala, languages not spoken by South Africans. As such, they needed language training so as to enable them to communicate. The study also found that the main problems faced by refugees in Johannesburg are lack of employment, problems with accommodation, difficulty in enrolling children in public schools and raising the required school fees and difficulties in accessing social services. The research report concludes by recommending solutions to MFI and other organizations whose mandate is to assist refugees and other forced migrants to embrace all vulnerable refugees within the MFI in an effort to make MFI available to all who require their services.",,,English,KEEP|REVIEW

O período escolhido marca a chegada de Manoel da Nóbrega e a presença de José de Anchieta na Colônia. Durante o processo de análise observamos as influências da educação humanística do Renascimento na elaboração e desenvolvimento da pedagogia inaciana, voltada para um aprendizado prazeroso. Verificamos que os primeiros documentos elaborados por Inácio de Loyola foram instrumentos que alicerçaram a pedagogia e as normas gerais da Companhia de Jesus, e merecem destaque por terem legitimado a elaboração da Ratio studiorum; modelo pedagógico vigente a mais de quatrocentos anos nos colégios jesuíticos, formando leigos e religiosos. Verificamos nas correspondências e documentos do século XVI que o catequizar e o educar dos nativos da América portuguesa se deram a partir da pedagogia jesuítica que privilegiava as estratégias lúdicas, tais como o teatro, o coral, o canto, as danças, a música, entre outras ações, promovendo a interação e a simbiose entre a cultura indígena e a cultura europeia.

The chosen period marks the arrival of Jesuit Priest Manuel da Nóbrega and the presence of the Jesuit missionary José de Anchieta in the then Portuguese Colony, now Brazil. During the analysis process, we have observed the influences of the humanistic education of the Renaissance in the preparation and development of the Ignatian pedagogy turned to a pleasurable apprenticeship. We noted that the first documents prepared by Ignatius of Loyola, were instruments that laid the pedagogy foundations and the general standards of the Company of Jesus and deserve distinction because of having legitimized the preparation of the Ratio studiorum, a pedagogic model in force for over four hundred years in the Jesuitical colleges, forming laymen and monks. We notice in the correspondence and documents of the XVI century that catechizing and educating the natives of Portuguese America happened from the Jesuitical pedagogy which was privileging entertainment strategies such as theater, corals, singing, dancing and the music amongst other actions promoting this way the interaction and the symbiosis between the native culture and the European culture.

Dick, fear of entropy is the primary catalyst for action, and one way the characters endeavour to escape entropy is through human evolution. Evolution is thought both to counteract entropy and to enable spiritual transcendence to a more permanent universe where entropy cannot follow. This thesis traces the two kinds of evolution found in these novels, the ineffective kind and the effective kind. The first is technological and left-brained; it tends to lead in Dick not to evolution and transcendence but to capitalist oppression, loss of agency, loss of identity, eugenics, and a totalitarian police state, all of which lead instead to devolution and an increase in the entropy of the universe. The second kind of evolution is biological and right-brained, and it stems from human empathy. Empathy, in Dick's novels, as it grows stronger, becomes telepathy and eventually forms the beginnings of a collective consciousness very much like Pierre Teilhard de Chardin's notion of a noosphere. This collectivity of mankind is brought about by love and empathy and will enable the transcendence and escape from entropy that Dick's characters seek. This thesis uses historical, philosophical, and scientific contexts to clarify this binary in Dick's work between left-brained technological devolution and right-brained empathic evolution. At their most ambitious, these novels supply a model for how Dick believes the human race ought to proceed if it intends to survive: not through advanced technological posthumanism, but through the simple advancement and dissemination of love and empathy.",|Academic Department:  English,,English,CULL|REVIEW

My research questions are anchored in four focal theoretical concepts: space, subjectivity, imagination and how these concepts are manifested in everydayness. I will not deal with them as separate, linear or static concepts but as dimensions that are constantly in dynamic change in relation to each other. I will not attempt a cause/effect analysis and I am not after a comparative or a descriptive analysis of the two cultural spaces I chose (Nahda Association- Jesuit's culture centre in Cairo, The Choir Project of Cairo). I believe this different and dynamic configuration of theorizing will enable different moods of thinking and greater capacity of exploration to acquire different kind of knowledge about the contemporary moment in Cairo's cultural scene, which is rapidly changing and how they can possibly provide fertile conditions for a different social imagination to take place.","|Advisor:  Sabea, Hanan",,English,KEEP|REVIEW

F., 1904–1984|Ignatius, of Loyola, Saint, c.1491–1556|Rahner, Karl, 1904–1984","The underlying, operative question of my entire project concerns the formal relationship of 'spirituality' to ethics. I contend that spiritual experience is normative for ethics: one's elected worldview orders feeling-values according to an appropriated scale of preference. To analyze the normative influence of spiritual experience on feeling-values, I begin by defining the term spirituality and then use an article written by Karl Rahner as a framework for identifying a particular form of ethics. I then examine the thought of Bernard Lonergan for an adequate account of subjectivity. With a viable anthropology in place, I examine Ignatius of Loyola's Spiritual Exercises to understand the normative function of spiritual experience. I conclude with a case study from Dorothy Day's The Long Loneliness that illustrates how spiritual experience functions as a normative source for moral-decision making.|A few important implications emerge. First, spirituality and spiritual experience are not a distinct, superfluous realm separate from the moral. To the contrary, spiritual experience is central to any discussion of values, and therefore, of ethics. Second, religious experience, like any other subjective data, must be understood, judged, and chosen if it is to be reliable. As data emerging from the realm of interiority, it should not be categorically dismissed as erratic, random, unintelligible, overly emotional, or exclusively subjective. Third, since values attach to worldviews, it is important for the ethicist to examine the way particular worldviews assemble scales of preference with regard to feeling-values. Furthermore, it is also important for the ethicist to understand how worldviews relate to each other: genetically, complementarily, or dialectically. Fourth, given transcendental method and the criteria for authentic subjectivity, there is a means to address the dialectic relationship of worldviews.","|Academic Department:  Theology|Advisor:  Haughey, John C.|Nilson, Jon",,English,CULL|REVIEW

In an address to Jesuit university deans and presidents, Nicolas noted two emerging frontiers in education: the frontier of depth and the frontier of universality. Students gain depth when the education they receive helps them “decide from inside” or be people of discernment. A Jesuit education on the frontier of universality provides students with an “Ignatian sense of breadth of belonging and wideness of concern and responsibility.” His remarks, based in part on the writings of the Jesuit’s 35th General Congregation (GC 35), offer a direction and framework for my research. This paper seeks to articulate just what is meant by Nicolas words, examining how the Society has carried out this mission and how this mission might best be appropriated in Jesuit colleges and universities given the contemporary globalized culture.","|Academic Department:  Sacred Theology|Advisor:  Guider, Margaret",,English,KEEP|REVIEW

It is not merely a doctrinal issue, but at the heart of our understanding of God, human being, and the total constitution of our world-view. Indeed, it is the place in which most of the horizons of theological subject matters are converged and diverged. Concerning the debate between the two competing views on God's eternity, the absolute timelessness in classical theism and the temporal everlastingness in contemporary panentheism, the purpose of this study is to present an alternative Trinitarian analogical understanding of God's eternity and its relation to time, especially, through a critical reflection of K. Barth's and H. U. von Balthasar's understandings, which can provide helpful resources for thinking further the debate on the timeless/everlasting eternity of God.|That is, while critically reviewing very diverse contemporary views on the topic, my particular concern is how we can simultaneously grasp not only the infinite qualitative difference but also the positive relationship between God's eternity and time in a proper way. In my view, it can be accomplished through reconceiving not only the nature of time but also that of God's eternity in a Trinitarian and analogical way. In other words, neither via negationis (i.e., timeless view) nor via eminentiae (i.e., everlasting view) can properly conceive the biblical teaching of the qualitative difference and the positive relationship between God's eternity and time. Therefore, a kind of via analogia through the following Trinitarian triple analogy, analogia vitae, analogia relationis, and analogia communicationis, centered in the only true God-given analogy, Jesus Christ, is the key to a proper conception of the biblical teaching of God's eternity and its positive relation to time. This analogical approach, which is based on a dynamic and dramatic concept of God's Being-as-life-in-relation and the Triune God's communicative action in eternity and time, can help us in solving the problem of the debate between the absolute timeless eternity and the temporal everlasting duration.","|Advisor:  Vanhoozer, Kevin J.",,English,CULL|REVIEW

Im westlichen Diskurs herrscht eine Auffassung vor, der zufolge die chinesischen Schriftzeichen eine „fast naturalistische Darstellung“ von Dingen seien, die unabhängig von der gesprochenen Sprache im Sinne „eines visuellen Objekts“ funktionieren soll. Dabei wird die Tatsache, dass auch sie wie alle anderen Schriftsysteme zur Wiedergabe der gesprochenen Wörter verwendet werden und dadurch funktionieren, ausgeblendet. Die Vorstellung der sprachunabhängigen chinesischen Schrift wirkt darüber hinaus auch auf die Kulturtheorien ein, die auf der Schrift basierend die chinesische bzw. asiatische Kultur zu charakterisieren und sie mit der europäischen zu vergleichen versuchen. Dabei ist zu beobachten, dass die angenommene sprachunabhängige Bildhaftigkeit oder Konkretheit der chinesischen Schrift zwar einerseits Grund für eine Aufwertung ist, wobei das aus ihr resultierende Denkmodell als ein alternatives des westlichen Denkens aufgefasst wird, dass aber letztendlich aus derselben Auffassung auch das negative Urteil entspringt, mit jener visuellen Konkretheit gehe ein ‚geringer Abstand zu den Gegenständen‘ einher und daraus folge eine Unfähigkeit zum abstrakten Denken bei dem, der sich dieser Schrift bediene. Die Frage, die vorliegende Arbeit durchzieht, lautet daher: Woher stammt dieser ‚Mythos‘ der chinesischen Schrift, der wiederum zurückwirkt auf das westliche Ostasienbild? Und warum bewahrt er sich so hartnäckig im westlichen Denken, dass seine Nachwirkung bis in aktuelle Theorien zu beobachten ist? Wie ist die ambivalente Einschätzung chinesischer bzw. ostasiatischer Kultur in ihnen zu verstehen, die aus derselben ideographischen Auffassung chinesischer Schrift stammt? Durch eine kritische Auseinandersetzung mit der Rezeptionsgeschichte der chinesischen Schrift unter Berücksichtigung des abendländischen China-, bzw. Ostasienbilds wird versucht, darauf zu antworten.||This dissertation deals with the Western views of Chinese characters. In Western discourses the Chinese written language has generally been viewed as a naturalistic representation of things, close to visual images (pictographs) or as a means of conveying ideas (ideographs), unrelated to spoken language. The fact that they reproduce spoken language like all other writing systems has been underexplored. Under this assumption, cultural theories have defined Chinese or Asian cultures as essentially distinct from European cultures. However, the language-independency and concreteness of Chinese script provides reason for revaluation of those views that consider the Chinese (or Asian) ways of thinking as an alternative to Western thought: that which ultimately arises from the negative judgments that those with visual concreteness are farther detached from objects, and are, therefore, unable to exercise abstract thinking. Through a critical analysis of the history of discourses of Chinese writings, this work address the following questions: Whence comes the ‘myth ''of the Chinese character, which, in turn, reinforces the Western views of Asia: why it remains so persistent in Western views as observed in contemporary cultural theories; how the ambivalent appreciation of Chinese or East Asian-culture resulted from the same ideographic view of the Chinese written language.","|Academic Department:  Philosophy|Advisor:  Böhme, Hartmut|Friedrich, Michael",,German,CULL|REVIEW

These tracts reflect a deep-seated fear of Catholicism long held by Protestant England. They also reflect the struggle to isolate and develop a sense of English national identity in the wake of the Henrician Reformation in the face of an enemy that was at once English and decidedly ""other."" Through the three separate, and very distinct, phases of Campion's mission prior to his capture and execution in 1581, Protestant authors such as William Charke and Thomas Lupton sought to use Campion's English heritage and Catholic allegiance to define what it meant to be a good, loyal Englishman.","|Academic Department:  English|Advisor:  Winston, Jessica",,English,KEEP|REVIEW

The poets I have selected--Wordsworth, Coleridge, Christina Rossetti, and Gerard Manley Hopkins--variously emphasized the ethical, religious, and metaphysical consequences of readers' responses to detailed features of their poetry, from its rhythms to its material presentations. They believed that subtle dynamics in a reader's experience could reform unethical habits of sympathetic pleasure (Wordsworth); encourage or forfeit free will (Coleridge); invite participation in a communion of saints (Rossetti); or produce an intimation of divine grace (Hopkins). As a result, each was sensitive to associations that their poetry might awaken, such as the expectations excited by meter in upper middle-class readers at the turn of the century or the values attached to the sonnet by its late Victorian cultivation. Treating their poems both as authorial strategies and instances of reception, I identify overlooked connections and tensions between their aims in revising reading, the forms of their poetry, and the reading practices and responses of nineteenth-century audiences. Rather than encouraging idealistic dismissal of the contingencies of reception, I argue, these poets' attempts to influence readers' responses made them sensitive to the uncertainties and historical constraints of writing and reading, and very often confronted them with contradictions in the motives, views of reading, and beliefs that drove their writing. My approach is historical and contextual, but I reject the idea that poems are artifacts decipherable only in terms of reconstructed authorial designs, distant contexts of reception, and forgotten habits of reading. To challenge this notion, I analyze recent readings of the poems I discuss for critics' evaluative assertions and hesitations over details. In many cases, the same formal dynamics that I argue are central to a poet's strategy have provoked early and recent readers of a poem. My refusal to lock poems into contextual coffins relates to another claim: that analyzing these poets' conceptions and instigations of reading, and the results of their efforts, can aid us in reconsidering recent practices of literary criticism and pedagogy.","|Academic Department:  English and American Literature and Language|Advisor:  Engell, James|Vendler, Helen|Sacks, Peter",,English,CULL|REVIEW

Explorers, merchants, and missionaries make their dangerous and once unimaginable voyages across the ocean, and their exotic tales become sought-after reading for an extensive readership. Twentieth-century theories of performative language proposed by philosopher J. L. Austin and French linguist Emile Benveniste underscore the complex role played by language in early French missionary writing regarding Brazil and Canada by the Capuchin Père Yves d'Evreux (1615), the Franciscan Recollect Frère Gabriel Sagard (1632), and the Jesuit Père Paul Le Jeune (1634), in terms of both the actual conversions of Native Americans and the missionaries' narrations about those conversions. While one of the hallmarks of the missionaries' discourse is the purported simplicity of their evangelical message, as they surrender their actions to God's will and claim to write without embellishment, both the various functions played by language in these writings and the ambiguity of their implied audiences make a theoretically informed study of these narratives important and valuable. The first chapter of this study explores the tenets of performativity and speech-act theory and their pertinence to these relations. The second chapter examines the cultural milieu of which the missionaries' texts are patent products, exploring early seventeenth-century history through the performative ideas of conversion and adherence while emphasizing the crucial political and religious matters that influence our narratives. The subsequent three chapters expose the three missionaries' use of what from a contemporary perspective can be termed performative language to interact with the Amerindians in the quest for widespread conversion and with their greater readership in pursuit of spiritual and material support for the missions. The importance of temporality in all its implications emerges from close readings of these récits, where the missionaries rely heavily on appeals to matters of time and commerce to attain their desired objectives with all involved parties.","|Advisor:  Goodkin, Richard",,English,KEEP|REVIEW

Led by Henri de Lubac and Jean Daniélou, they formed part of the nouvelle théologie, an influential French reform movement that flourished from the 1930s until its suppression in 1950. After identifying a certain lacuna in the secondary literature, this thesis attempts to remedy certain historical deficiencies by constructing a history both sensitive to the wider intellectual, political, economic, and cultural milieu of the French interwar crisis, and that establishes continuity with the Modernist crisis and the First World War. Chapter One examines the modern French avant-garde generations that have shaped intellectual and political thought in France, providing context for a historical narrative of the Fourvière Jesuits more sensitive to the wider influences of French culture. This historical narrative of the Fourvière Jesuits follows four stages. Chapter Two examines the influential older generations that flourished from 1893 to 1914, such as the Dreyfus generation, the generation of Catholic Modernists, and two generations of older Jesuits, which were instrumental in the Fourvière Jesuits' development. Chapter Three explores the influence of the First World War and the years of the 1920s, during which the Jesuits were in religious and intellectual formation, relying heavily on unpublished letters and documents from the Jesuits archives in Paris (Vanves). Chapter Four analyses the crises of the 1930s, the emergence of the Fourvière Jesuits' wider generation, and their participation in the intellectual thirst for revolution. Chapter Five examines the decade of the 1940s, which saw the rise to prominence of the members of the generation of 1930, who, thanks to their participation in the resistance, emerged from the Second World War, with significant influence on the postwar French intellectual milieu.","|Advisor:  Gaine, Simon",,English,KEEP|REVIEW

Approximately 400,000 Graduate Record Examination General Tests are administered each year to students hopeful that their scores will win them admission to graduate school, or secure them financial awards for graduate study and research. Although it has been more than twenty-five years since the first study questioned the validity of the GRE for older students, state universities as well as private universities continue to use it as a primary factor in admissions. This study explored graduate admissions requirements and procedures for older female students in the 25 Jesuit institutions that offer graduate programs in education. Potential participants received a survey by mail. Participants are those admissions personnel who returned their survey. Names of potential participants were taken from the institutions' websites, or were gathered by contacting the graduate school to obtain names of those involved in the admissions process. The use of follow-up telephone interviews was employed to gain a greater understanding of answers given on the surveys. These occurred when the participant listed their phone number and agreed to be contacted for additional information. Data was also gathered by visiting websites from the Jesuit institutions. The study was conducted during Saint Louis University's fall, 2005 semester.|The study showed that admissions requirements vary from institution to institution. It also showed that the GRE remains as an important component of the admissions decision even though many of the respondents expressed some confusion with the interpretation of the scoring process especially pertaining to raw scores, summed scores and cut-off scores. The responses also demonstrated that the GRE Guide to the Use of Scores , published annually by the GRE was not utilized as it was intended. The study also showed that admissions personnel have limited, if any knowledge of validity studies regarding GRE scores and older female students. In addition to contributing to the literature on the subjects of older adult female students and the GRE, the results provide critical information to Jesuit institutions about the graduate admissions process.","|Advisor:  Breslin, Richard",,English,KEEP|REVIEW

In the theology of Balthasar, Christian prayer is considered to be a participation in intra-trinitarian dialogue (prayer) and Christian vocation is a sharing in the intra-divine self-giving (mission). In the divine life, loving dialogue (prayer) and mutual self-giving between the Father and the Son in the Holy Spirit are one reality of love. Therefore in an authentic Christian life, which is a participation in divine life, prayer and vocation cannot be separated, but must also build a unity. For Balthasar prayer is a consequence of a previous vocation, and it could influence subsequent vocations. During prayer one has to be prepared to receive a call from God; therefore prayer is a vocational reality. In Balthasar's understanding of prayer, obedience to the calling and sending will of God is central. Obedience to one's vocation is the criterion of the genuineness of prayer. On the other hand, a vocation can be received and discerned only in the context of prayer; thus vocation needs prayer. The unity between prayer and vocation in everyday life can be illustrated by the mutually penetrating relationship of contemplation and action. Although Balthasar emphasizes this unity of prayer and vocation, he still maintains that prayer is not simply a function of personal vocation. Prayer life should also include an aspect of absolute gratuity, a certain ""pointlessness"" which can be described only with the terms of self-less love, which has its root in the Trinitarian life. The divine initiative of love fuses a dynamic unity of prayer and vocation, and this unity is essential for Christian life and ecclesial renewal. Balthasar's approach can deepen and challenge our contemporary theology of prayer and vocation, even our understanding of the meaning of human existence.",,,English,CULL|REVIEW

Dissertation,"Kotani, Noriko",2010,Studies in Jesuit Art in Japan,"Princeton, NJ",Princeton University,408,PhD diss.,,,,,,Arts -- History -- Regional,Asia -- Japan,"Valignano, Alessandro, 1538–1606","This dissertation examines Jesuit art production in Japan from the period between the late sixteenth century and the early seventeenth century. The project of such art production was initiated by Italian Jesuit Alessandro Valignano, and supervised by Italian painter Giovanni Niccolò during the Jesuit presence in Japan, which began in the latter half of sixteenth century and lasted until 1614. The center of production of this type of art was the workshop adjunct to the Jesuit seminary, where Niccolò trained about a dozen students with European painting techniques, such as chiaroscuro, foreshortening, modeling and linear perspective. The discussion is centered on Christian paintings and a selection of printed images produced in Japan by Niccolò’s students. By examining the formal characteristics of these works in comparison with their European sources, this dissertation views Jesuit art in Japan as part of a sequence of artistic products and practices brought to Japan by Jesuit missionaries and European traders. At the same time, the discussion argues that these works deserve to be regarded independently because of their unique origin, system of production, and history. Chapter One provides an overview of scholarship on the field and makes the specific intervention of this dissertation clear. The discussion focuses on the problem of so-called Nanban art, the term with which Jesuit artworks in Japan have been labeled. Chapter Two discusses the founding and operation of the Jesuit seminary and art workshop. A Madonna and Child and a Salvator Mundi along with twelve paintings framed utilizing techniques from traditional Japanese craftsmanship are discussed to illustrate stylistic features characteristic of Japanese students at the seminary. Chapter Three provides a historical outline for the arrival of European visual images, which functioned as sources for the Jesuit art production in Japan. Chapter Four looks closely at two paintings of Our Lady and the Fifteen Mysteries as case studies. Drawing on primary sources, including Jesuit letters and reports, as well as the relationship between the art production in question and European sources, this dissertation challenges conventional views of the Christian art produced in Japan during the period in question in order to provide a new, art-historically based perspective, on the first encounter between Europe and Japan.","|Academic Department:  Art History|Advisor:  Kaufmann, Thomas DaCosta",,English,KEEP|REVIEW

The history of Alaskan Christian missions is unique: Alaska developed as an arbitrary cultural/geographical construct and also one of the few regions where representatives of all three main historical branches of Christianity - Catholic, Orthodox, and Protestant - proselytized simultaneously. Alaska is viewed as a special landscape where dynamic cross-cultural interactions and multi-denominational -in the case of Protestant - missionary ventures took place. Fierce competition characterized the regional cultural exchange at some times, reciprocity and friendly contacts at others. Those involved were the priests of the Russian Orthodox Church, Jesuit missionaries, Presbyterian, Episcopalian and Moravian preachers - men and women - as well as representatives of the Russian American Company, the Hudson's Bay Company's entrepreneurs and American fur traders. In this geographically remote and environmentally severe region, the Native populations - the Aleuts and Athapaskans, Tlingits and Haidas, Tsimsheans and Inuits -played an independent and crucial role in cross-cultural conversation. They were active participants in a complex process in which different sides had to alter their cultural attitudes, religious traditions, and ideological values in continuous interaction with each other.

The analysis raises several issues of interest in soteriology today.|The Introduction presents a brief biography of each theologian, a summary of relevant work, and mention of important influences.|Chapter I introduces the parameters for the investigation, delineating the timeline of the exchange between Balthasar and Schwager, the methodology, problems faced by the investigation, and their mitigation.|Chapter II describes essential elements of Balthasar's view of the cross, beginning with an elucidation of the major elements that ground it. Balthasar views the death of Jesus as primarily a drama of vicarious atonement carried out between Father and Son wherein the interrelated themes of divine wrath and judgment play important roles. Emphasis is placed upon points of contrast with Schwager.|Chapter III highlights essential points of Schwager's soteriology that are of relevance to this study. Schwager's work is inspired by a contemporary view that finds theological meaning in the problematic of human violence. This gives him a hermeneutical framework that leads to a fresh understanding of the event of the cross along with an associated view of divine wrath and judgment that contrasts with that of Balthasar.|The analysis comprising Chapter IV illuminates the important similarities and distinctions between the two theologians and clarifies the critical exchange between them. The critique offered by each side is organized by topic and analyzed for efficacy.|A final chapter assesses the arguments and analyzes them for the contribution they make to our understanding of salvation. One section reviews some of the more recent related work for its ability to help resolve the difficult issues raised by the contrasting views of Balthasar and Schwager. Points of departure and some lines of investigation are suggested for further work. Since both Schwager's and Balthasar's positions are characterized by advantages and difficulties, I suggest current lines of research with potential for mitigating the problems while retaining the benefits.","|Academic Department:  Theology|Advisor:  Galvin, John P.",,English,CULL|REVIEW

The purpose of this study was to examine why Georgetown Universitys School of Continuing Studies Applied Division lacks an executive education presence in Russia, an important emerging market. The study also provides recommended solutions to close the gaps that may prevent senior leadership from successfully launching these programs. This qualitative study used survey and interview data from a complete sample of 10 senior leaders at the School who will be involved in developing custom programs for international participants. Findings from this study indicate that the Schools leaders have limited information about Russia and the educational needs of potential Russian clients. Stakeholders exhibited high levels of interest and self-efficacy to offer custom programs to Russian clients. The study also revealed the need for clearly stated organizational goals for country-specific executive education initiatives. The recommended solution was to establish a senior level position for international strategy to help increase country-specific knowledge, generate perceived value and develop a comprehensive strategic plan for the new initiative. If successful, the School will increase relationship building with Russian partners to contribute to the organizations financial and mission-driven goals. The study also creates an assessment of knowledge and motivation amongst leaders instrumental in the successful implementation of the initiative. Other tertiary institutions may use the findings to develop and implement strategic goals relating to executive education in emerging economies.","|Advisor:  Robison, Mark Power|Picus, Lawrence O.|Diamond, Michael A.",,English,CULL|REVIEW

Both in the Muslim and Christian traditions, pilgrimage is a rich and complex religious practice that has served as a privileged milieu in which pilgrims and their communities attempt to foster diverse kinds of communion with God and His spiritual company of saints and other sacred figures, including the founders and paradigmatic ancestors of the local community. Precisely due to its richness and complexity as a spiritual and religio-cultural practice driven by the deeper and inclusive dynamics of communion, pilgrimage has also become a crucial practice in which a distinctive and hybrid religio-cultural identity is forged and negotiated in creative and fruitful ways—among others through the process of engaging various forms of otherness including other religious traditions and cultures—in the context of a long historical continuum that is also marked by tensions and ambiguities. Based on the underlying and multifaceted category of communion with God, the self, and the other that lies at the heart of the pilgrimage traditions in Islam and Catholicism, and guided by the method of the new comparative theology, this study attempts to offer a focused analysis of the major ways in which this dynamic of communion is played out in the deeper shared features and intimate encounters that exist between these two pilgrimage traditions in south central Java. Carried out from the perspective of the Catholic tradition, this study also seeks to explore the ways in which the extraordinary depth and breadth of these dynamics of communion in the Muslim and Catholic pilgrimage traditions—that in Catholic theology can be placed under the inclusive category of the work of the Spirit (pneumatology)—can serve as a creative avenue for a comparative theological enrichment of our contemporary understanding of the Catholic doctrine and practice of communio sanctorum (""communion of saints and the holy""). Drawing from both the most salient features of both the Muslim and Catholic pilgrimage practices in south central Java as well as the corresponding insights from the larger Islamic and Catholic traditions, this proposed pneumatological framework for a renewed understanding of the Catholic theology of communio sanctorum can be seen as the modest constructive fruit of this study's comparative theological engagement with the dynamics of pilgrimage in these two traditions. Through this process, the Catholic theology and practice of communio sanctorum is also made more richly anchored in the Catholic principles of communion, mediation, and sacramentality. And since this very process includes other religious tradition(s), the Catholic doctrine of communio sanctorum becomes remarkably inclusive and expansive as well, thus becoming a profoundly ""catholic"" theological vision.","|Advisor:  Morris, James W.",,English,CULL|REVIEW

One way in which they did this was by commissioning operas based on the lives of saints from the poet Giulio Rospigliosi later Pope Clement IX, and papal musicians Stefano Landi and Virgilio Mazzocchi. Aside from the merit of providing an in-depth look at four of these little-known works, Sant'Alessio 1632, 1634, Santi Didimo e Teodora 1635, San Bonifatio 1638, and Sant'Eustachio 1643, this dissertation also discusses how these operas reveal changing ideas of faith, civic pride, death and salvation, education, and the role of women during the first half of the seventeenth century. The analysis of the music and the drama stems from studies of the surviving manuscript scores, libretti, payment records and letters about the first performances. This dissertation also provides a discussion of the religious culture in which these operas took place by examining other contemporary primary sources such as sermons, histories of saints' lives, spiritual exercises, Jesuit school plays, books of manners and social decorum, and accounts of festivals held in Rome during the papacy of Pope Urban VIII.","|Academic Department:  Music|Advisor:  Carter, Tim",,English,KEEP|REVIEW

Outre les impacts culturel, économique, politique et social que produisent les nouvelles techniques de l'image animée, ce travail de recherche pose la question philosophique et théologique du statut de la vérité dans ce nouveau cadre. Il appert, en effet, qu'une pensée de l'image animée doit se doter des catégories affranchies du paradigme platonicien de l'image et de la ressemblance et assumer les exigences d'un plan d'immanence stricte. Par ailleurs, ce paradigme obligé à penser une épistémologie qui sache articuler ce statut de vérité avec une anthropologie paradoxale où les sujets se voient amputés de leur capacités constitutives: de sujets ils deviennent objets. Le magistère de l'Eglise catholique a su détecter assez tôt la reconfiguration anthropologique induite par l'image animée sans toutefois assumer le renversement philosophique dans son expertise technique de l'image. A partir de cet état des lieux, une théologie fondamentale de l'image animée doit pouvoir articuler une épistémologie avec une anthropologie et une philosophie qui sachent honorer le projet ecclésial de la communication et de la mission. Réclamée par les rédacteurs du décret conciliaire Inter mirifica (1963), puis par ceux des instructions pastorales Communio et progressio (1971) et Aetatis novae (1992), cette théologie trouve ses fondements dans ce travail. A la lumière du mystère de l'incarnation, elle tente de dépasser le clivage entre transcendance et immanence et de définir le statut de la vérité comme le résultat d'un fragile processus d'objectivité du sujet à conquérir et à entretenir dans la durée. L'enjeu consiste donc en une proposition théologique à partir du plan d'immanence de Gilles Deieuze à l'aide d'un ""principe"" d'incarnation de Hans Urs von Balthasar et de Paul Ricoeur.||The 20th century saw a change in the philosophical paradigm induced by motion pictures techniques. In addition to the cultural, economic and social impacts new motion pictures techniques have brought about, the purpose of this research is to define the status of truth in the new framework from a philosophical and theological point of view. Indeed, it seems that a conception of motion pictures should encompass categories liberated from the platonician paradigm of image and resemblance, and assume the demands of strict immanence. Moreover, this paradigm forces us to conceive an epistemology articulating this status of truth with a paradoxical anthropology in which human beings have their constitutive capacities amputated: from subjects they become objects. The magisterium of the Catholic Church has been able to detect the anthropological reconfiguration induced by motion pictures quite early. However, it has not assumed the philosophical upheaval stemming from its technical expertise of motion pictures. On the basis of that review, a fundamental theology of motion pictures should be able to articulate an epistemology as well as an anthropology and a philosophy in which the ecclesiastical creed of communication and mission would be hnonured. Awaited by the drafters of the conciliar decree Inter Mirifica (1963) and by those of the pastoral instructions Communio et progressio (1971) and Aetatis novae (1992), this theology has its bases in this research. In the light of the mystery of the incarnation this is an attempt to go beyong the cleft between transcendence and immanence, and to define the statuts of truth as a result of a fragile process of the subject's objectivity which is to be conquered and maintained perennially. Thus, what is at stake consists in a theological proposition based on, first the plane of immanence by Gilles Deleuze and then Hans Urs von Balthasar's and Paul Ricoeur's ""principle"" of incarnation.","|Advisor:  Holzer, Vincent",,French,CULL|REVIEW

To go further, this analysis links these phases with the theory of eroticism and the inner experience proposed by Georges Bataille. It is shown that the mystic writings of Castillo are akin to key concepts in these theories such as the quest for continuity, the emptiness of the ego in the mystical union, and the problem of language to express the ineffable.","|Advisor:  Schmidt, Rachel",,Spanish,CULL|REVIEW

On the one hand, European missionaries have introduced the idea that becoming a Christian primarily involves a cognitive change in how one perceives the world, translating into a ""spiritual"" but not physical journey toward ""heaven."" On the other, Mi'kmaq who are also connected to their traditional way of knowing and being see this as inadequate, a pale reflection of the full-bodied experience with reality and within reality that fosters a robust non-dualistic spirituality for this part of life's journey and the next.|Given this apparent conflict, I sought to investigate the nature of the relationship precisely between these different understandings. To focus the research to a manageable size, I carried out a literature review of the writings of the Jesuits between 1600 and 1750 to determine their perception of the nature of the spiritual and of spirituality – both for themselves and, through their writings, for the Mi'kmaq. I sought to do so by asking four principal sets of questions:|1. What understanding of the spiritual emerges from the descriptions available in the literature concerning the behavior and beliefs of the Mi'kmaq and those of the French/Jesuits as represented in the French encounter between 1600 and 1750 CE?|2. Where does the understanding of the spiritual lie for both peoples during this period? For example, in reading the archives, can one distinguish an understanding in the ideological realm as opposed to the ontological realm of life? Further, is spirituality rooted in the behavioral realm or is it rooted outside the person in creation itself? Finally, recognizing the difficulties inherent in accessing an oral culture through literature, is there evidence of holistic/monistic or dualistic understandings of spirituality in either or both cultures in the literature?|3. In an analysis of texts written between 1900 and 2000, does evidence emerge that shows continuity or change in the understanding and practice on the ground between 1600 and 1750, for both groups – either as missionary or the subject of mission? How has the understanding of the two groups changed over time? How do their understandings now affect the ministry situation?|4. What can be learned through this comparison between the worldviews of the two groups over time, particularly in relation to the theology of mission that directs the task of spreading the good news of God's love for us in Jesus Christ? That is, are there differences in the understanding of the spiritual that might account for the embrace of or failure to embrace Christian faith by Native North American people?|The work began with a description of the context of each of the two groups of people – the Jesuits and the Mi'kmaq. I examined the contexts in which their understanding of the nature of the spiritual and of spirituality had been established and considered any influences that were identifiably a part of that understanding. I then looked at the changes over time in the encounter of the two groups. What kinds of changes might have occurred during the 150 years of the encounter between the Jesuits and the Mi'kmaq? Finally, I used a comparative analysis to determine what, if anything, that had changed for them had been carried over into the twentieth-century experience of each. To access a better comparative context, I included a brief description and investigation of the Acadians – a people who were both influenced by and influencers of the Mi'kmaq and whom the Jesuits established significantly in their Catholic faith.|I examined both culture and context in addition to investigating the concept and application of worldview as a means of accessing and assessing the nature of the spiritual. Finally, I subjected the entire body of the investigation to a meta-analysis so as to determine what, if any, conclusions could be drawn from the investigation. In the analysis we focused on questions of ontology, epistemology, and worldview as a part of assessing the data.|The research raised questions concerning the nature of spirituality as conceived of by the Jesuits and as experienced by the Mi'kmaq. In the former case it was obvious that cognition played the most significant role in their understanding of spirituality; in the latter, intuition and engagement were of primary focus. Application of the findings has implications not only for how we engage mission but also for how we understand the wider focus of the Creator's work in that creation.",,,English,KEEP|REVIEW

The study examines the Jesuit journal La CiviltÃ  Cattolica in the period 1850–1903 as a source exemplifying the attitude of the intransigent hegemony within the Church. As a first step, aspects in the discourse of the Jesuit journal that are most constant over time are described. These are themes inherited from Catholic tradition, constructing an image of 'the Jew' that may be circulated independently of the reality of Jewish life. Secondly, the activation of this image in the journals rhetoric related to Italian unification is analyzed. The analysis reveals a strong connection between the position towards Italian nation building and the usage of anti-Jewish rhetoric. Thirdly, the research indicates that the Jesuits approaches to the 'Jewish question' and antisemitism were determined by the wish to reinforce a Catholic national identity. The study confirms that antisemitism was institutionalized within La CiviltÃ  Cattolica in the two last decades of the nineteenth century. However, the investigation adds important nuances to the prevailing ideas about the journal, by suggesting that the majority of the College did not support the anti-Jewish propaganda of the few members that most energetically wrote about Jews. The conclusions of this study point in two directions. On one side, the investigation indicates that the approach towards Italian nation building should be taken into account when studying the rhetoric concerning Jews of the Roman Catholic Church in the second half of the nineteenth century. On the other hand, it supports the thesis that the contribution of the Church towards shaping Italian national identity should be taken seriously in the studies of the Risorgimento.

Cependant, il choisit d'entrer au Couvent des Minimes d'Amiens en 1640 pour y poursuivre sa quête de Dieu dans une vie d'humilité, de pauvreté, de chasteté, d'obéissance, de carême perpétuel, dans le service des plus pauvres et suivre ainsi la devise du fondateur de l'Ordre: "" Charitas "".Mais les Minimes de Paris, surtout ceux de la Place Royale, où il est envoyé, sont aussi de brillants intellectuels, appréciés des grands de ce monde. Nicolas Barré se dépense sans compter jusqu'à ce qu'il tombe malade. Rétabli, il est nommé à Rouen en 1659. Son désir de servir Dieu et de le révéler aux masses populaires qu'il côtoie, prend une dimension exceptionnelle. Nicolas Barré se démarque alors de son Ordre (tout en y restant) et suscite l'initiative d'écoles pour les enfants pauvres. Diverses rencontres avec des personnages influents lui permettent de donner corps à ses idées qui seront exécutées par des jeunes filles généreuses. Cependant, Nicolas Barré refuse obstinément les "" fondations "" pour ne dépendre que de Dieu et pour assurer à son Association une totale mobilité apostolique. Il se révèle un pédagogue hors pair et initie à l'enseignement des jeunes filles qu'il rassemble dans des séminaires de formation. Ce n'est qu'au 19ème siècle, pour répondre à l'appel missionnaire, que l'Association, des "" Maîtresses Charitables "", appelées aussi depuis le 17ème siècle "" Sœurs de l'Enfant-Jésus "", sera transformée en Institut religieux.||Born in a bourgeois family, apparently preserved from the scourges which crossed his region, (wars, epidemics, famine), Nicolas Barré became an excellent student in a Jesuit school. However, he chose to enter the convent of Minims in Amiens in 1640 to continue his search for God through a life of humility, poverty, chastity, obedience and perpetual Lent in the service of the poorest, following the motto of the founder ""Caritas"". But the Minims of Paris, especially those of the Place Royale where he was sent, were also brilliant intellectuals, greatly esteemed by the important people in society. Nicolas Barré worked without sparing himself until he fell ill. When he was recovered he was sent to Rouen in 1659. His desire to serve God and to reveal Him to the ordinary people he rubbed shoulders with took on an exceptional dimension. Nicolas Barré differentiated himself from his order (although he didn't leave it) by opening schools for poor children. Encounters with influential people allowed him to give shape to his ideas which were carried out by generous young women. However, Nicolas Barré obstinately refused financial ""foundations"" in order to depend only on God and to give his Association complete apostolic mobility. He reveal himself to be an outstanding pedagogue and gathered young women into seminars to form them as teachers. It was only in the 19th century that, in answer to a missionary call, the ""Maîtresses Charitables"", (who from the 17th century were also called ""Sisters of the infant Jesus"") became a Religious Congregation.","|Academic Department:  History and Civilization|Advisor:  Tallon, Alain",,French,CULL|REVIEW

A partir dessa ideia, o objetivo desta pesquisa é demonstrar, por meio de diferentes abordagens teóricas e suas articulações, diversas possibilidades interpretativas que as imagens fotográficas provocam ou sugerem. Para tanto, tem como foco os espaços de duas realidades fotográficas: o espaço do real e o espaço da imagem. A partir dessas duas demarcações, este texto desdobra-se em possíveis articulações, dinâmicas e experiências que as relações entre elas suscitam nos dois maiores sujeitos da fotografia—fotógrafo e leitor. Para tanto, pensamentos de autores que observam questões dos espaços do mundo e das imagens, como Boris Kossoy, Edgar Morin, Michel de Certeau, Michel Maffesoli, Tatiana Levy e Cremilda Medina, são apontados e relacionados com os espaços da fotografia. De cada teórico apresentado, propostas sobre os espaços são destacadas por meio de três olhares distintos e sobrepostos nas narrativas fotográficas da contemporaneidade: o da complexidade, o dos afetos e o da poética. Com um esboço inicial de cada teórico, suas ideias são aplicadas isoladamente a diferentes trabalhos fotográficos. A seguir, articulações entre as propostas teóricas dos diferentes autores são compostas para elaborar diversas possibilidades simbólicas dos espaços em diferentes trabalhos de fotografia produzidos pelo mundo. Acredita-se que nesse processo, questões ainda não tão claras sobre os espaços da fotografia, e da própria fotografia como elemento expressivo e simbólico, possam passar para um primeiro plano.||This research looks for a deeper comprehension of the different realities that make up image production and reception processes: the dynamics, symbolic relations and subjects involved. From this idea, the goal of this research is to demonstrate, by means of different theoretical approaches and their articulations, various interpretative possibilities that the images provoke or suggest. Consequently, it focuses on the spaces of the photographic realities: the reality space and the image space. From these two demarcations, this text unfolds into possible articulations, dynamics and experiences that the relationship between them suscitate on the two main subjects of photography—photographer and reader. To do so, the thinking of different authors that observe issues of spaces of the world and of images, such as Boris Kossoy, Edgar Morin, Michel de Certeau, Michel Meffesoli, Tatiana Levy and Cremilda Medina, are identified and related to the photographic spaces. From each author, a set of proposals on the spaces are highlighted by three distinctive and superimposed points-of-view in the photographic contemporary narratives: of complexity, of affections and of poetics. With an initial sketch of each theorist, his/her ideas are applied separately to different photographic works. Following, the articulations among different authors' theoretical proposals are combined to develop various symbolic possibilities of the spaces in several photographic essays produced around the world. It is believed that in this process, issues not yet clear regarding the spaces of photography, and photography itself as an expressive and symbolic element, may came to the foreground.","|Advisor:  Kossoy, Boris",,Portuguese,CULL|REVIEW

Before Dominica became a formal British colony in 1763, Caribs, French settlers, free and enslaved Africans, and people of mixed ancestry inhabited this island frontier. The frontier is defined as a transformative, dynamic contact zone where there were daily interactions among people of varied backgrounds. Moreover, settlement of Dominica is limited to a band of coastal enclaves because of the island's mountainous topography and thick vegetation. The landscape is approached as the materiality of an ongoing interaction between Jesuit ideology and the specific and historically situated variables or ""boundary processes"" in this enclave, which then shaped social and economic relations in the frontier. Excavations reveal the spatial layout of the church, factory, and residence and sampled subsurface layers dating to the Jesuit period. The spatial data reveal that the mission site prioritized visibility of the cross and church and created a network of free and enslaved settlers in the Grand Bay enclave. Exchange networks are shown by fragments of hand-made pots, industrially produced wares, and imported European manufactured goods. By focusing on the frontier context this study improves understandings of space within Caribbean frontiers and explores interconnections with colonies and the metropole. This study departs from historical accounts which situate Grand Bay in the context of how this site contributed to the dissolution of the French Society of Jesus, and broadens the approach to missions, as Grand Bay functioned as a multicrop plantation using enslaved African labor and a parish church in a neutral island.","|Academic Department:  Anthropology|Advisor:  Armstrong, Douglas",,English,KEEP|REVIEW

The following study undertakes such an analysis, first reconstructing the origins of the quarrel in the religious houses and print shops of Antwerp, next looking at the Carmelite perspective and the ""argument from tradition"" which buttressed the Carmelites' claims to antiquity, and lastly tracing the history of the ""erudition"" which allowed the Bollandists -- the Jesuit scholars responsible for that monument of hagio-historiography known as the Acta Sanctorum -- to mount their critique.

Written by a Neapolitan church music director from ca. 1610–1640, this treatise singularly bears witness to the censorship of Carlo Gesualdo's Responsoria and a public demonstration in its defense. In contradistinction to all hypotheses about Gesualdo's infamous chromaticism, d'Avella's treatise reveals that Gesualdo employed out-of-tune sonorities as text-setting devices. Following d'Avella's cue, new parallels are drawn between Gesualdo's Tenebrae and the physico-theological reenactments of the crucifixion that Giambattista Marino performed with out-of-tune musical instruments in his contentious Holy Week orations, Le dicerie sacre. Harmonic, rhythmic, and text-underlay analyses of d'Avella's musical citations indicate that Gesualdo endeavored to compose his Responsoria in accordance with post-Tridentine strictures and, moreover, Gesualdo assuredly did not stage his own tormented life in his musical telling of the Passion of Christ by means of extreme chromaticism. When placed within the context of the long sixteenth-century, Gesualdo's out-of-tune sonorities in fact follow a long line of precedents in spiritual madrigals—even Palestrina's 1581 book, long regarded as archetypal of Tridentine ideals. Further historical-theoretical concordances to this out-of-tune practice are found in El melopeo y maestro of Pietro Cerone, L'Imperfettioni della moderna musica of Artusi, and the Musurgia universalis of Athanasius Kircher. D'Avella's polemical defense of Gesualdo was pedantic and invoked the sophisticated mathematical musical theories of the classical authority Boethius to supply incontrovertible reasons for Gesualdo's chromaticism. His precisely indicated musical tunings and notations vastly differ from the theoretical music of Nicola Vicentino, whose imposing Ferrarese treatise, L'Antica musica ridotta alla moderna prattica, instigated many humanist yet, as I argue, extraneous ancient Greek explanations for Gesualdo's harmonies. However, unexpected plagiarisms of the treatise on the Guidonian gamut in Francesco de Brugis' Graduale ultimately undermine d'Avella's theoretical credentials and pedagogical prescriptions for Gesualdo's chromaticism. The insurmountable problems that d'Avella's neo-Boethian and Guidonian theories posed his exceedingly few readers are gleaned from Giovanni Francesco Beccatelli's scathing Annotazioni upon the Regole and, above all, Charles Burney's ""Gesualdo Controversy."" Beyond reconsidering d'Avella's Regole, the dissertation calls for new performance practices of Gesualdo's chromatic music.","|Advisor:  Heller, Wendy",,English,CULL|REVIEW

While this success is well documented, significant challenges currently threaten Catholic schools: demographic shifts, the changing role of religion in the lives of American Catholics, increasing education options for parents, and a paucity of priests. Many Catholic schools have been forced to restructure or regionalize. Many single-parish schools have been closed because they cannot financially continue.|It is the purpose of this research to investigate and then promote a more collaborative, codeterminative model of governance for Catholic schools by relating a historical account of America's Church governance and the precedent set by John England, first Bishop of Charleston, circa 1820. Bishop England laid the foundation for greater democracy and broader equity with the laity within the native Church in the governance of the American Catholic Church's temporal matters.|The spirit of independence helped form the early American Catholic Church under the leadership of Bishop John Carroll. He had envisioned a church that would recognize the pope as the spiritual head of the universal Church; but the American Catholic Church would conduct its temporal affairs in deference to the federal government in the new nation.|While Carroll established Georgetown University, St. Mary's Seminary in Baltimore, and supported the use of the vernacular in liturgy, his true vision of American governance in the Church would not be achieved until Bishop John England wrote a constitution delineating the responsibilities of the clergy and the laity and forming a bicameral governance structure for the diocese of Charleston. His clearly defined constitution alleviated problems between the clergy and laity that had arisen under trusteeism.|With the changing structures of today's Catholic schools, priests and laity are called to greater collaboration. School boards must have clearly defined authority and responsibilities, especially accountability. Selected board members must have the talent and ability to lead schools that require greater stewardship and collaboration.","|Academic Department:  Educational Leadership|Advisor:  Hunt, Thomas C.",,English,CULL|REVIEW

For instance, is faith portrayed primarily as assent to conceptual statements of belief? This dissertation will argue that faith, as portrayed by various Catholic novelists, is fundamentally a person's imaginative orientation to trust and hope in the presence of God's grace in creation and human life. I will approach this issue through the category of uncertainty, specifically uncertainty's relationship to faith, as this relationship emerges in novels by François Mauriac, Graham Greene, Flannery O'Connor, Muriel Spark, Mary Gordon, and Shusaku Endo. I will examine their novels through the lens of two paradigms: The experience of uncertainty as a catalyst for Christian faith and the experience of uncertainty as a challenge and possible critique of a prior Christian faith. My discussion will build upon the thought of Martha Nussbaum, David Tracy, Karl Rahner, and Charles Taylor to consider the kind of ""thinking"" and imagining about faith presented by through the genre of the novel. What will emerge in this investigation is the necessity of uncertainty as a means to prompt conversion, both before and after the conscious acceptance of religious belief. Further, this experience of uncertainty is manifested in the novels through literature's affective appeal which reveals both the ambiguity of emotions as well as the ambiguity of faith itself. That is, faith will be seen as existing in a dynamic, existential relationship to uncertainty such that faith should be understood not as primarily propositional, intellectual assent, but as a surrender of the all-too human desire for certainty in the face of life's struggles, tragedies, and fickleness, a surrender that orients the believer towards an imaginative vision of ultimate reality lived with hope and trust in Divine Mystery.",,,English,CULL|REVIEW

F., 1904–1984","The thesis explores the nature of organization and governance by applying a method of intentionality analysis as elaborated by the Canadian philosopher and theologian, Bernard Lonergan, in his two monumental works, Insight: a study of human understanding, and Method in theology. The project arose from the writer's own experience in management education and consultancy. Admittedly, intentionality analysis has not been a major theme in the management literature. However, the late Sumantra Ghoshal drew attention to the consequences of neglecting the dimension of intentionality in business education and management theory, such consequences as unethical practices and even the collapse of corporations, as was the case with Enron. In a paper published by the Academy of Management Learning and Education in 2005, Ghoshal raised a number of crucial and epistemological questions, though he offered no easy answers. In the effort to rise to Ghoshal's challenge, this thesis argues that Lonergan's method of intentionality analysis opens new ways to approach the theory and practice of management. It thereby suggests a model relevant to all managerial tasks. Hence, it repeatedly stresses the value of asking questions and of attending to data. It indicates what is involved in the understanding of a given situation, in the making of judgments based on experience, and in the deciding on particular courses of action. In so doing, the thesis clarifies a number of intricate epistemological questions, while emphasising throughout, the vital role of self-knowledge and self-possession. The thesis is essentially a step-by-step discussion of the various elements in intentionality analysis in the context of corporate management. Hence, for the sake of brevity, it designates its intentionality analysis method"" with the acronym, IAM (and in reference to organisational operations, IAMO). ...""--Abstract.",|Academic Department:  Theology,,English,CULL|REVIEW

But none of their pictures - neither the outlines of barometric tubes employed by Parisian salon impresario Jacques Rohault, nor the still lifes and landscapes into which Leiden university professor Wolferd Senguerd etched Cartesian matter, and certainly not the copies of Descartes's figures with which Jesuit priest Gabriel Daniel refuted the new philosophy—agreed on a single visual idiom for revealing nature's laws.

Wynne, S.J. (1859–1948). Widely recongized as an editor, educator and historian, Wynne was among the foremost Catholic intellectuals of the early twentieth century. In addition to serving as founding editor of the Catholic Encyclopedia (1907) and the Jesuit periodical America (1909), Wynne was vice-postulator for the canonization causes of the first American saints, the Jesuit Martyrs of North America, and for St. Kateri Tekakwitha. He was also a founding member of a number of important early twentieth century professional organizations, including the American Catholic Historical Association, the National Catholic Education Association, the American Federation of Catholic Societies, and the National Catholic Welfare Council's Bureau of Education. The dissertation explores Wynne's contribution to the American Catholic intellectual tradition. In particular, it explores the ways in which Wynne used the Catholic Encyclopedia and America to negotiate American Catholic identity during the Progressive Era. Using a lens of theological inculturation, the dissertation argues that Wynne presented an alternate version of social reform rooted in a distinctly neo-Scholastic vision of society, a vision that enabled him to champion Catholic participation in American culture, critique the culture for its weaknesses, and successfully avoid the theological controversies of Americanism and Modernism. The dissertation concludes that Wynne's legacy, which was animated by intellectual concerns characteristic of the Society of Jesus, was part of a much broader flowering of early twentieth century American Catholic intellectual thought that made him a key forerunner to the mid-century Catholic Revival.","|Advisor:  Portier, William L.",,English,KEEP|REVIEW

This study argues that Loyola's student protesters were acting as Catholics against situations they believed were immoral and unjust. In this sense, they were ahead of the Jesuit clergy at Loyola, who took action only after student protest on those issues. Indeed, student protest filled a void of moral leadership that the Jesuit administration at Loyola failed to provide. Moreover, in the areas of student participation in university governance, changes in curriculum and university restrictions, and student rights and freedoms, the student protesters joined with Catholic commentators who advocated for major changes at the country's Catholic universities.",|Academic Department:  History,,English,KEEP|REVIEW

This study focused on two questions, (a) How do leaders perceive the future of Jesuit higher education? and (b) What key factors identified by these leaders will lead to the most desirable outcome for Jesuit higher education in the next twenty years? Interviews were conducted with ten leaders from the Jesuit higher education community. The ten participants included presidents, provosts, high-ranking officials, and directors. Eight participants are employed in universities across the United States, and two participants are employed as administrators of Jesuit education. The methodology used in this study was Ethnographic Futures Research, an approach used to elicit participant perceptions of alternative futures from optimistic, pessimistic, and most probable future scenarios. This study aimed to present a strategic outline in the form of recommendations to guide leaders of Jesuit institutions through times of rapid and imminent change. Findings from this study include identification of common perceptions of factors that will influence change to the future of Jesuit higher education. Factors of change include leadership strategies, economic impact, technological advances, and evolving student demographics. Findings further revealed more specific driving forces of change, including faculty influence, societal influence, and Jesuit identity issues. A general discovery made by this study was the significant acceptance that change cannot be avoided and strategies must be implemented so as not to respond and react to these changes, but to engage in change with the confidence only attained through strategic and ongoing future studies that will aid in the sustainability of Jesuit higher education institutions in the United States.",,,English,KEEP|REVIEW

Although the catacombs had been important devotional sites for the cult of martyrs and relics throughout the Middle Ages, the 1578 catacomb discovery was the first time that Romans connected the catacombs with the early Christian cult of images. Only after 1578 did scholars and antiquarians begin to collect and study early Christian frescoes and antiquities found in Rome's numerous catacomb sites. Their research culminated in the publication of Antonio Bosio's Roma sotterranea (1635), the first treatise on the Roman catacombs. After the Council of Trent (1545–1563), Catholic scholarship on the catacombs defended the early Christian origins of the cult of martyrs, relics, and images. I argue that the Tridentine Church's claim of continuity motivated the study of early Christian art in the catacombs in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. By critically evaluating images and archeological sources to support an interpretation of the Church as semper eadem (ever the same), Bosio and his sixteenth–century predecessors contributed to the development of modern historical and archeological methods. This dissertation explores the juxtaposition of imaginative and analytical interpretations of the Roman catacombs in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. Early modern descriptions of the catacombs characterize these burial sites as emotive worship spaces for the early Church that evoked Christian suffering, martyrdom, and devotion to the cult of saints. I argue that the gruesome martyrdom imagery commissioned to decorate S. Stefano Rotondo and SS. Nereo e Achilleo in the last two decades of the sixteenth century imaginatively recreated what contemporaries thought early Christian worship would have been like in the catacombs. As the first in-depth study to consider the relationship between the exploration of the catacombs and the first large-scale martyrdom cycles in the late sixteenth century, this dissertation demonstrates how vivid pictorial imagination of the Christian past inspired the early Christian revival movement in post-Tridentine Rome.",,,English,CULL|REVIEW

Ces œuvres se distinguent effectivement des autres méditations par le fait qu’elle furent intégralement éditées en 1717 sous la forme de trois recueils – Theatrum Solitudinis Asceticæ, Theatrum Affectuum Humanorum et Theatrum Doloris et Amoris - qui totalisent environ 850pages de livrets et plus de 3 000 pages de musique.Les recherches tiennent à expliquer d’abord l’existence de cette source exceptionnelle à tous égards par une étude précise des conditions de représentation, replacées dans le contexte plus général de la vie musicale à Munich. La thèse offre ensuite une analyse dramaturgique du Theatrum Solitudinis Asceticæ qui revendique une filiation directe aux Exercices spirituels de St Ignace de Loyola, fondateur de la Compagnie de Jésus.

These dramas were called Considerationes or « DramaticMeditations » and were intended for the moral edification of their congregation members. The dramas’plot was written by the congregation’s Jesuit priest while bavarian musicians composed the music.This work specifically treats the Considerationes by Franz Lang (1654 – 1725), which wereperformed between 1695 and 1712. As opposed to other meditations, Lang’s Considerationes wereentirely printed in the year 1717.

Then follows a dramaturgical analysis of the Theatrum Solitudinis Asceticæ, which waspostulated by Ignatius of Loyola within the Spiritual Exercises. After a part about the literary work of Lang, my work closes with an analysis of the Considerationes – which were composed by Johannes-Andreas Rauscher, who died in 1702 - regarding musicology.

Classic accounts of modernism emphasize ""impersonality"" as the prime method for artists seeking cultural and ethical authority in the period after 1880. This project digs into what I argue is ultimately the more palatable capacity of literary beasts to animate a similar poetics of authority. Where doctrines of impersonality often resorted to figures of the inorganic in order to simultaneously disavow and indulge the expression of authorial intention, modernists such as Gerard Manley Hopkins, Virginia Woolf, James Joyce, Rudyard Kipling, and Marianne Moore instead avowed their didactic ambitions by appealing not to traditional expressive and explicit methods nor, on the other hand, to the complete evacuation of personality, but to the vitality and instinct of animals. More than any platinum filament (T. S. Eliot's famous catalyst), animals offered modernists a vocabulary for the bodily and behavioral mechanisms by which individuals become ethical and historical subjects. In my chapters, I examine specific formal effects that require animal energy—from the modeling of queer poetic virtuosities upon animal instinct (as in Hopkins' windhover, for example, or Moore's slapstick critters) and the casting of fictional characters along evolutionary-typological lines (as in Woolf's The Waves) to the anticolonial implementation, even, of a ""bestial"" prose style resistant to modernism's self-authorization (exemplified by the indifferent creatures we find in Finnegans Wake).","|Academic Department:  Comparative Literature and Literary Theory|Advisor:  Esty, Jed|Beckman, Karen|Rabaté, Jean-Michel|Saint-Amour, Paul",,English,CULL|REVIEW

It remains a major theological problem that needs to be addressed within the mainline churches of Zimbabwe today. Instead of ignoring or dismissing the ancestor cult, which deeply influences the socio-political, religious, and economic lives of the Shona, churches in Zimbabwe should initiate a Christology that is based on it. Such a Christology would engage the critical day-to-day issues that make the Shona turn to their ancestors. Among these concerns are daily protection from misfortune, maintaining good health and increasing longevity, successful rainy seasons and food security, and responsible governance characterized by economic and political stability. Since the mid-16th century arrival of Jesuit missionaries in the Mutapa Kingdom, the Church has realized that many African Christians resorted to their ancestors in times of crisis. Although both Catholic and Protestant missionaries from the 1700s through the early 1900s fiercely attacked Shona traditional beliefs as superstitious and equated ancestors with evil spirits, the cult did not die. Social institutions, such as schools and hospitals provided by missionaries, failed to eliminate ancestral beliefs. Even in the 21st century, many Zimbabweans consult their ancestors. The Shona message to the Church remains ""Not without My Ancestors."" This dissertation examines the significance of the ancestors to the Shona, and how selected denominations and new religious movements have interpreted and accommodated ancestral practices. Taking the missiological goal of ""self-theologizing"" as the framework, this dissertation proposes a ""tripartite Christology"" of ""Jesus the Family Ancestor"", ""Jesus the Tribal Ancestor,"" and ""Jesus the National Ancestor,"" which is based on the Shona ""tripartite ancestrology."" Familiar ecclesiological and liturgical language, idioms, and symbols are used to contribute to the wider Shona understanding of Jesus as the ancestor par excellence, in whom physical and spiritual needs--including those the ordinary ancestors fail to meet--are fulfilled.","|Academic Department:  Theology|Advisor:  Daneel, Marthinus L.|Robert, Dana L.",,English,KEEP|REVIEW

As an interdisciplinary effort, it is intended for several audiences. For readers interested in science history, it offers a history of two terms stress and strain central to modern physics. As well, in discussing the ideas of various scientific authors (primarily William John Macquorn Rankine, William Thomson, P.G. Tait, and James Clerk Maxwell), it indicates several contributions these figures made to larger culture. For readers of Hopkins poems and prose, this dissertation corresponds with a recent trend in criticism in its estimation of Hopkins as a scientifically informed writer, at least in his years post-Stonyhurst. Accordingly, this dissertation presents readings of Hopkins poetry and prose in light of developments in Victorian energy physics. Three claims span the chapters pertaining to Hopkins oeuvre: First, that Hopkins distinctive terminology of stress and instress expresses the energetic relations between objects. Second, that Hopkins metaphors and analogies are unusual in that they often signify literal relationships between things compared, particularly when metaphysical forms of stress or instress are likened to physical forms of energy. And third, that in Hopkins writings the natural world and the supernatural order of creation are contiguous, and that energy suffuses both.",,,English,CULL|REVIEW

The Jesuits' strategy is traceable to Matteo Ricci's early missionary approach of accommodation to Chinese culture, which aimed to prove grounds for a Confucian-Christian synthesis based upon complementary points between Christian theology and their interpretation of Yuanru (Original Literati Teaching). Their synthesis involved both written and oral rhetorical techniques that ranged from attempts to show compatibility between different religious values, to the manipulation of texts, and to outright deceit. Personal witness, observation, and interpretation played a key role in Jesuit group translation projects. French and Chinese apologetic texts composed to prove grounds for the repeal of the 1724 proscription edict contain these approaches. The Lettres edifantes et curieuses ecrite par des missionnaires jesuites (1702–1776) contain examples of this approach, as well as the Ruijianlu (1735–1737). Memorials in the Ruijianlu cited favorable legal precedents and imperial patronage rendered to Xiyangren (Men from the West). Jesuits presented their case for toleration of Christianity in the Ruijianlu in terms of Chinese notions of hospitality, diplomacy, and defense found in texts from as early as the Zhou dynasty. They cited an enduring Chinese defensive notion of ""welcoming men from afar"" (rouyuanren), but the court refused to return to this soft policy. The Qianlong Emperor rejected the Kangxi era policy of ""welcoming men from afar"" regarding established missions. In 1735 the imperial Board of Punishments re-enforced the proscription order against Christianity in military units and also ruled that baptism of abandoned infants by a Chinese convert constituted religious heterodoxy based on the Qing Code (Article 162). The twenty-one Jesuits (not expelled in 1724) remained in imperial service and at liberty to practice their religion among themselves. Officials pursued a severe policy of punishing any cult deemed heterodox according to statutes of the Code. Persecution of Christians increased throughout the eighteenth century, but abated during the reign of the Daoguang Emperor (1821–1851) when most anti-Christian edicts were rescinded and a subsequent imperial edict pardoned those Christians who practiced the faith for moral perfection.",|Academic Department:  History,,English,KEEP|REVIEW

Thematic, theological, and methodological affinities between Balthasar and the Russians include a shared broad-mindedness toward navigating between the ancient Christian tradition and modern philosophical developments, a variously critical reception of German Idealism and Romanticism, and in focused treatment of the relation of God and world, immanence and transcendence, freedom and necessity, as well as kenoticism, eschatology, Trinity, history, pneumatology, cosmology, and aesthetics. It is the burden of this study to demonstrate, as evidenced by his critical excavation of the Russians, that Balthasar's own theological method can, contravening the opinion of some of his critics, be characterized as quintessentially non-nostalgic, structurally hospitable to non-theological categories, non-canonic sources, and modes of speculative thinking which probe, but do not exceed the elastic boundaries of tradition. This thesis shall be tested systematically through an analysis and assessment of the principles according to which Balthasar allows, repeats, or excludes elements in the functional test-cases of the Russians along the following sites of inquiry: (1) art and aesthetics, (2) the problems of myth, freedom, and evil, (3) ""anthropocentric"" eschatology, including death, judgment, and the postmortem state, and (4) ""theocentric"" eschatology, including figurations of the Antichrist and paschal trinitarianism. Because Soloviev, Berdyaev, and Bulgakov critically appropriate German Idealism and Romanticism to varying degrees in their religious philosophies, F.W.J. Schelling serves throughout as a tertiary conversation partner and a primary catalyst for productively analyzing Balthasar's process of adjudicating the value and reliability of philosophical and theological sources. Through constructing a dialogical space which keeps Balthasar, Schelling, and the Russians in conversation, this dissertation suggests that Balthasarian theological method operates fundamentally in a pneumatic register, grounded in orthodox commitments and structurally open to developments in theology.","|Academic Department:  Theology|Advisor:  O'Regan, Cyril J.",,English,CULL|REVIEW

Along with the Jesuits, a colony of sedentary Tlaxcaltecan Indians with royal privileges settled among the Laguneros to serve as example in teaching them an agricultural lifestyle and incorporate into Spanish institutions. The Laguneros were the most populous northern Indian group, but disappeared by the middle of the seventeenth century. Afterward the Parras Indians were mostly privileged Tlaxcaltecan that successfully defended their rights to water, lands, and exemption from forced labor. Parras experienced a wine-making boom that made its Tlaxcaltecans an unusually wealthy Indian group; the Jesuits were crucial in the way these unique socioeconomic structures developed.","|Academic Department:  History|Advisor:  Bakewell, Peter|Weber, David J.",,English,KEEP|REVIEW

The interpretation of this pericope will be preceded by an initial examination of the overall portrayal of Jesus' character in the Gospel of Mark, highlighting the development of divine and human identity tensions through Jesus' titles and roles. Next, the evolution of Christology will be traced throughout church history to understand how the traditional expression of Jesus' dual nature corresponds with and influences a modern day reading of Jesus' character. This chronological review will lead into a description of the work done by the twentieth century theologian Karl Rahner on the topic of grace. The universal applicability of Rahner's philosophical conception of grace makes his theological framework suitable as a lens for the interpretation of the Syrophoenician woman story. In an exegetical analysis of the pericope, the issues of humanity, divinity, and identity will be accounted for in relation to God's offer of self-communication, the divine invitation to participate in the gift of God's grace. By respectfully considering each character as a human being free to self-determine his or her identity, Rahner's theology of grace will be used to suggest that Jesus and the Syrophoenician woman both accepted the divine offer of self-communication, resulting in a favorable narrative outcome. Operating on the Rahnerian assertion that grace is ever-present and available to all human individuals, this thesis concludes that Jesus and the Syrophoenician woman were beings involved in a mutual partnership through which God's self-communication was revealed. In closing, possible areas for further research will be considered alongside the practical implications for living in constant attunement to God's divine offer of grace--Page i-[ii].",,,English,KEEP|REVIEW

This revolution involved the confrontation between two divergent ethical rules employed by a person confronting a doubtful moral issue: the medieval rule that one should for safety's sake follow the law rather than the choice of his or her conscience (Tutiorism) and the modern rule that one should embrace the moral freedom of a conscience to follow even the less plausible of two probable opinions (Probabilism). Although this liberalization originated as a practical way to alleviate the dubious conscience of medieval penitents in the context of sacramental confession, Probabilism profoundly affected the early modern prince, lawyer, physician, merchant and scholar in the daily performance of their civil duties. To analyze this crucial transition, I have compiled the first exhaustive census of nearly 800 titles on sacramental confession by early modern Jesuits. The dissertation also focuses on a document in which the interaction of casuistry with the 'spoils of Egypt'---a biblical expression used in the Jesuit Constitutions to indicate classical pagan literature---can be traced: the codification of Jesuit pedagogy known as Ratio studiorum (1599). A comparison of the three superseded versions of the Ratio clearly suggests how systematic contact with Greco-Roman literature, and especially with Ciceronian rhetoric, may have influenced the Jesuit conscience to abandon Tutiorism and espouse Probabilism.",|Academic Department:  History,,English,KEEP|REVIEW

F., 1904–1984","This dissertation considers the mystery of the relationship between human free choice and God by focusing on the Controversy de Auxiliis (1582–1607) and the thought of Domingo Báñez, O.P. (1528–1604) in particular. The dissertation comprises four chapters and a conclusion preceded by a preface and brief historical introduction. The preface introduces the issue to be explored and the motivations for exploring it before providing a general synopsis of the dissertation that is more detailed than the present abstract. The historical summary that follows introduces a theological debate that has become widely unfamiliar to contemporary theology, even while conceptually, that debate remains perennial. The four-chapter body that follows may be divided into two general parts: Broadly, chapters One and Two exposit Báñez’s thought, while chapters Three and Four critique it. Chapter One explores Báñez’s positive account of physical premotion, human freedom and sin. Chapter Two examines Báñez’s critique of Luis de Molina S.J.’s alternative proposal, in conjunction with some contemporary sources from both sides of the debate (Molina was Báñez’s principal adversary in the Controversy de Auxiliis). Báñez’s line of critique in Chapter Two is found to be cogent. Chapter Three investigates Molina’s critique of Báñez and finds it too to be cogent, even though Molina’s positive account was found to be problematic in Chapter Two. Chapter Four begins by exploring Bernard Lonergan S.J.’s work on divine causality and human free choice. Lonergan attempts to provide a fresh historical reading of Aquinas that is unencumbered by the presuppositions of the Controversy de Auxiliis. The first part of Chapter Four explains Lonergan’s critique of Báñez and finds it convincing, while the second part of the chapter finds Lonergan’s interpretation of Aquinas problematic from a theoretical standpoint. Chapter Four then offers a constructive critique of Lonergan’s interpretation before advancing an alternative way to think about God’s causation of human free choices. In closing, this dissertation argues that God creates human free choices, but that in creating a human free choice, God, or God’s creative will, is not an antecedent condition that determines choice. Rather, God creates the entire reality of a human free choice—both what it is and that it is—and in so doing, part of the reality God creates just is that choice’s being up to its human agent.","Electronic copy restricted until 4th June 2015.|Academic Department:  School of Divinity|Advisor:  Holmes, Stephen",,English,CULL|REVIEW

Nonetheless, debate is ongoing over the integration, ordering and the substantive separation of these stages. An upshot of these debates is that each stage is loosely allied to a particular socio/political structure: hunter/gatherer or tribal societies, nation states, and globalisation respectively. In the current alloying of electronic communication and globalisation though there is a rising interest in what is termed new regionalism, or regionalisation, even regionality. Accordingly, Chora-Logic: Electracy as Regional Epistemology examines the possibility of an emerging conceptual alliance (and through reference to two Australian regions a sometimes embodied and situated one) between the embryonic communicational infrastructure of electracy and the age-old spatial scale of the region, a relationship that might just come to represent a means of rethinking the civic and the psychic, the commercial and governmental frameworks of an electro-energised global skein. It may also be a way of reinvigorating a study in the relation of the body (in its capacity as a citizen-subject) to the nation state, especially as all these entities are increasingly though ambiguously constituted in and through globalisation. The method of synthesising and antagonising these relations between electracy and regionalism is through the philosophy of chora, Platos conception of embodied place as found in the middle section of the Timaeus, coaxed along by a range of interpretations of this important genesis myth in Western philosophy. In particular, chora is taken up in the work of Gregory Ulmer as a key method in the ongoing conceptualisation of an electrate epistemology. Arising out of these concerns Chora-Logic is an experimental re-configuration of the sovereign, abstracted and disembodied citizen-subject of the Cartesian mould (a significant psycho-political mooring of the literate national character) to one situated both in the virtual density and multidimensional actuality of a particular place (organically conceived of herein as an idiosyncratic mix of psychic, domestic, workplace, local and regional proximities), but whose both dis embodied self-knowledge and world-knowledge are now increasingly realised by access to an electronically arbitrated global/regional polis. In sound-bite terms, the bumper sticker could just as easily proclaim the following inversion: Think and feel chora-logically, act globally. Finally, the nucleus of Chora-Logic: Electracy as Regional Epistemology is a risky praxis whose experimental eddy (in both formal and content terms) spins within the current ambivalence, uncertainty and fast-paced change in electronic communicative arrangements (electracy), as these are themselves wrapped in the psychic and socio-political variabilities of spatial affiliation, all of which are symbiotically entwined regardless of the historical period and/or the geographical context.","|Academic Department:  Arts, Humanities, Education",,English,CULL|REVIEW

Dans notre recherche, nous nous proposons de faire une étude monographique afin que le grand séminaire du Cameroun, Otélé (1949–1968), distant d'une soixantaine de kilomètres de Yaoundé, soit un observatoire pour étudier à travers la formation des futurs prêtres, le passage d'une Église missionnaire à l'émergence d'une Église ""africaine"" nationale. Ainsi, la période retenue permet de cerner la prise de distances voire des rejets avec l'héritage missionnaire qui avait reproduit un modèle occidental pour privilégier l'enracinement africain tant dans le recrutement des formateurs que par l'invention de nouvelles pastorales. Deux interrogations principales sous-tendent notre recherche. La première concerne la formation des séminaristes camerounais par des ""étrangers"", d'abord les Bénédictins (1949–1963) puis les Jésuites (1963–1968) avant que la relève ne soit assurée partiellement par des ""nationaux"". La deuxième porte sur l'acculturation. Comment les candidats au sacerdoce appréciaient-ils l'approche pédagogique, le transfert culturel, d'abord aux méthodes monacales, puis à l'esprit plus diocésain? Cette question nous a amené à traiter des difficultés d'assimilation religieuse et du clivage entre prêtres réguliers formateurs et futurs prêtres séculiers aux objectifs divergents, les premiers obéissant à la règle d'un ordre monastique et les seconds appelés à vivre en paroisse et parmi les laïcs. Dans le même temps, l'accent a été mis sur les évolutions et les changements au cours de cette période influencée par la décolonisation et l'indépendance du Cameroun, qui concernent l'ère bénédictine, et par le concile Vatican II englobant la direction jésuite, faisant émerger l'inculturation, une manière pour les séminaristes de reconquérir et réaffirmer leur identité culturelle.| |The chosen subject is situated between the religious history, the cultural and social history, studying the history of the relations and the international cultural exchanges. In our research, we suggest to make a monographic study so that the high seminary of Cameroon, Otélé (1949–1968), fur away from Yaounde by about sixty kilometres, would be an observatory to study through the vocational training of the future priests, the transition from a missionary Church to the emergence of a national ""African"" Church. So, the chosen period allows us to understand the distances, even the denials of the missionary inheritance that had recreated a western model in order to favour the African implanting, both in the recruitment of the trainers and by the invention of new pastoral theologies. Two main questionings underlie our research. The first one concerns the training of the Cameroonian seminarists by foreigners, at first the Benedictines (1949–1963), then the Jesuits (1963–1968), before it was partially insured by natives. The second one is on acculturation. How did the candidates for the priesthood appreciate the educational approach, the cultural transfer from the monastic methods to a more diocesan spirit? This question brought us to discuss on difficulties of religious assimilation and the cleavage between formatives who were regular priests and future secular priests with divergent objectives. The first ones obey the rule of a monastic order and the second ones conscript to live in parish and among the laymen. At the same time, the emphasis was put on the evolutions and the changes during this period influenced by the decolonization and the independence of Cameroon. It concerns the Benedictine era, and by the Vatican II council including the Jesuit management, which facilitated the forming of the ""inculturation"", a way for the seminarists to reconquer and reaffirm their cultural identity.","(Grenoble)|Academic Department:  Contemporary History|Advisor:  Vial, Éric",,French,CULL|REVIEW

Existing theological treatments of disability are insufficient insofar as they either continue to endorse the normative subject endowed with reason and will, or they polemically reject the ideals of freedom and self-determination and valorize dependence and passivity as the fundamental way of being human. As an alternative, I look to Karl Rahner as an unlikely ally whose theological understandings of knowledge, freedom, and agency illuminate the mystery of being a human person, with or without disabilities. This perspective suggests how the capacities of freedom and agency can co-exist with a commitment to vulnerability and dependence. I build upon Rahner’s framework in order to show how freedom emerges through relations of dependence, and how vulnerable human relationships differ from fundamental human dependence on God. What emerges is a spiritual vision of human beings as creatures oriented to the infinite mystery of God.","|Advisor:  O'Regan, Cyril",,English,CULL|REVIEW

Rahner understood that the People of God as a whole are ""Hearers of the Word."" They share the collective responsibility of transmitting revelation from age to age. Committed to an ecclesiology of functioning communion, Rahner understood authoritative teachers of the faith to have a normative role in interpreting God's revelation; yet the insights and collective faith consciousness of the faithful (sensus fidelium) aslo provide a legitimate norm for the faith.

The analysis of Balthasar's thought is prefaced by an historical survey of conversion through the writings of St. Augustine of Hippo, St. Thomas Aquinas, OP and Bernard Lonergan, SJ. Following this historical contextualization, conversion is examined from three perspectives: (1) As a single essential form which may be manifest in a variety of ways because it is necessarily an individualized process. (2) As an individual dramatic aspect within the larger drama of redemption. (3) As a dialogue between God and the human being.|Under each of these three larger motifs, I analyze the role of each of the divine persons, (because conversion is always an act of the entire Trinity), the role of the human being (particularly with respect to freedom), the essential role of the Church, and the Marian dimension.|A final section addresses the significance of his conversion theory for the new evangelization as presented in the Encyclical, ""Ecclesiam Suam "" and continually revisited by Popes John Paul II and Benedict XVI. Both the current and former popes were close friends of Balthasar and shared a similar desire for a renewed evangelization.

In chapter one I set the context of developments and crises in the twentieth century, and propose that Bernard Lonergan's theological method provides a way to engage the complex issues involved in interreligious relations. Because he offers a cognitional theory and an epistemology that are empirically grounded in the believing subject, Lonergan's approach is firmly and securely rooted and yet is open to the concrete reality of the religious other. In chapter two I summarise and refine elements of Lonergan's analysis of the dynamics of consciousness and propose that they form a common ground"" on which believers from different religions might meet. I extend that to the construction and mediation of meaning in chapter three, and to religious meaning in chapter four. In particular, I use these dynamics to distinguish between ""spirituality"" and ""religion"". I conclude that spirituality forms the ""common horizon"" in which believers from different religions might meet. In chapter five I show how these same dynamics underlie the structural relations between different religions, the personal relations built by dialogue between believers from different religions, and a theology of religious plurality. In chapter six I show how familiarity with these dynamics enlightens our understanding of selected core themes in Christian theology. My innovative treatment of aspects of Trinitarian theology, in particular the divine missions, will underpin my argument for Christian involvement in interreligious relations.

Crucial to understanding this loss of traditional Amerindian culture, however, is a parallel understanding of the cultural and intellectual forces coming from Europe which shaped and often restricted the Jesuits’ attitudes toward native customs. Examining the first fifty years of the cross-cultural encounter through the lens of dream interpretation, this paper argues that the Jesuits made several adjustments to their initial assumptions and responses toward native dreams. Although the Jesuits originally denounced all native dreams as superstitious, the advent of native convert dreams forced the Jesuits to recognize the placement of at least some native dreams within traditional Christian categories of visions and miracles, even though some of these dreams retained characteristics which they condemned in traditional native dreams. Over time, however, the Jesuits’ accommodating policy drew criticisms from competing missionaries. Because the dispute centered on events in China rather than Canada, the acceptability of convert dreams was resolved first by a silence on the issue in public records and later by a retraction of the papal condemnation of the Chinese Rites ruling and certain accomodationist practices. Ultimately, the issue of dreams reveals the deep tensions faced by the Jesuits in evaluating and accepting practices, even in part, that did not fit precisely into orthodox categories during a period when the Catholic Church, an institution that, like many other European centers of power, strove to buttress their institutional authority and to reduce the varieties of acceptable worship and belief in the face of enormous expansion in intellectual ideas and varieties of cultural practices around the world.","|Academic Department:  History|Advisor:  Van Kley, Dale K.",,English,KEEP|REVIEW

They also appear as relatively accommodating to indigenous ways of life and concerned to safeguard Native American Christians, by means of segregated mission ""reserves,"" from a morally corrupting French civilization. Such views are challenged by reading the Relations from New France (1632–1673), authored by Paul Le Jeune and other missionaries, in the light of their original, Parisian milieu of publication and reception, and by examining the metropolitan history of the mission enterprise. In partnership with their powerful publisher Sébastien Cramoisy and coteries of French government officials, wealthy nobles, and merchants, the Jesuits of New France were precocious proponents of a Paris-centered civilizing mission to other parts of the world by means of an expanding, French-imperial state and economy. Their program, urged very publicly in Paris, had implications for poor, socially marginal populations within and emigrating from France as well as for missionized Native Americans. These Jesuits were committed, for religious and secular reasons, to cultivating a trans-Atlantic, imperial culture of French ""civility,"" material consumption and aesthetic tastes according to new elite, urban standards, and deference to new political and social hierarchies. As is seen especially in their steady, if largely unsuccessful campaign in France for a war of conquest against the Five Nations Iroquois, the missionaries at times favored violence and coercion to achieve this vision of French hegemony in North America. The Relations not only raised awareness about the missions among pious Catholics and potential donors, but also propagandized on behalf of royal power and marshaled colonial experiences to influence the agendas of wealthy and educated elites interested in social and cultural change both within France itself and abroad in the expanding network of French overseas possessions.","|Academic Department:  History|Advisor:  Eire, Carlos M.

Building on classical elements, Christian scripture adapted Greco-Roman friendship types to portray relations between Jesus Christ and his disciples – and within the early Church – as characterized by friendship. Though these friendship types waxed and waned as the Christian tradition developed, they returned to prominence during the Renaissance and later in twentieth-century thought. Representing the Christian (and Ignatian) humanist tradition,Ricci developed a friendship-based approach in his treatise On Friendship and implemented this in his missionary work in sixteenth-century China. Though his qualified acceptance of Confucian rites was revised by the universal Church, aspects of his approach were promoted in the early twentieth-century by the first apostolic delegate to China, Costantini.

En tant que réalisateur, scénariste et théoricien du cinéma, Ruiz propose une réflexion théorique originale sur son médium, réflexion qui fait appel à plusieurs champs du savoir et met en relief les relations entre diverses pratiques artistiques. Le caractère multidisciplinaire de sa démarche expliquerait en partie la difficulté qu'éprouvent les critiques à aborder l'ensemble de l'oeuvre de Ruiz, qui paraét inclassable en termes d'écoles, de genres ou d'esthétiques cinématographiques. Trois vies et une seule mort, généralement ignoré dans les ouvrages consacrés à Ruiz, a pour particularité d'esquisser des liens entre l'art de la mémoire et le cinéma. Bien que les oeuvres Mémoires des apparences et Le Temps retrouvé, réalisées par le même cinéaste, témoignent également des possibilités qu'offre le médium cinématographique pour traduire la mémoire, Trois vies et une seule mort est le seul film de Ruiz axé sur la mémoire qui ne soit pas l'adaptation d'une oeuvre littéraire. Créée et scénarisée par Ruiz, l'oeuvre étudiée porte sur l'art de la mémoire, emprunte certaines de ses caractéristiques formelles et propose une expérience spectatorielle sollicitant un constant «travail de mémoire». Trois vies et une seule mort établit ainsi de puissantes relations entre le caractère «défamiliarisant» (Victor Chklovski) de l'image cinématographique, le processus de réminiscence et les «traces d'oralité» (d'après la conception de l'oralité proposée par Walter J.

This thesis adds to that body of work by investigating the emergence and significance not of the participant, but rather of the nonparticipant who exists within the city system but is denied interaction within that system. I term this figure the hermit. Chapter 1 focuses on establishing a theoretical framework for the hermit's emergence, using primarily Michel De Certeau's notions of city participation from his book The Practice of Everyday Life. De Certeau's ideas are then supplemented with Paul Virilio's theory of the accident as well as Hayden White's investigation of the emergence of the Wild Man in Western thought, both of which help to explain one way in which we can understand hermitage as emerging within various city systems. Chapter 2 uses Robert Louis Stevenson's The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde to explore a relatively basic manifestation of urban hermitage as seen specifically from the perspective of an upper class, Western viewer. This is then contrasted in Chapter 3, which uses Indra Sinha's Animal's People to 1) expand the idea of hermitage from the individual to the community (namely, the postcolonial city), and 2) allow us to investigate hermitage from a vantage point within hermitage itself. In both case studies what emerges by way of conclusion is not hermitage as a positive force, but rather as a diagnostic tool for identifying problems within social systems which might otherwise go unnoticed and unarticulated.","|Advisor:  Marzec, Robert",,English,CULL|REVIEW

Pedro Arrupe, S.J. was elected the 28th superior general of the Society of Jesus in 1965 and served in that role until 1983. As superior general, Arrupe sought to shape the Jesuits in the spirit of the vision of Vatican II, as well as the original charism of the founder of the Jesuit, St. Ignatius. The questions this dissertation seeks to answer is how Fr. Pedro Arrupe understood solidarity in light of his own life and theological perspectives and then how his view continues to shape Jesuit education today. |The first chapter examines solidarity as an element of Catholic social teaching, which sets the historical and theological context for the rest of the dissertation. It briefly looks at the historical development of solidarity within papal encyclicals, as well as within selected contextual theologies. |The second chapter is the heart of the dissertation, which looks at Arrupe's contribution to solidarity through three lenses: solidarity with those suffering, solidarity through inculturation and solidarity created by the Eucharist. Drawing from historical, sociological and theological sources, Arrupe's vision of solidarity is strongly influenced by his twenty-seven years in Japan and his dedication to Ignatian spirituality. The chapter also puts Arrupe's work in dialogue with other theologians wrestling with similar issues in order to demonstrate how Arrupe adds to their analysis. |The third and fourth chapters examine the way Arrupe's ideas have influenced those who came after him. Chapter three explores the superior generals since Arrupe, Fr. Kolvenbach and Fr. Nicholas, and how they are extended Arrupe's ideas of solidarity towards Jesuit education and interreligious dialogue. The third chapter also looks at two other Jesuits, Fr. Howard Gray and Fr. Greg Boyle, each applying solidarity to Jesuit education and Jesuit social justice apostolates. The fourth chapter is a case study based on my experiences working with immersion groups at John Carroll University and the way solidarity is taught through these experiences. Specifically, the focus is on two experiences going to Immokalee, Florida in 2011 and 2013 and the positive and negative elements of immersion programs in developing solidarity in Jesuit educated university students.","electronic resource|Worldwide Access|Jim Bailey|Anna Scheid, Daniel Scheid|Menkhaus, James",,English,KEEP|REVIEW

I argue that the overwhelming disproportion between black and white infant mortality rates over this entire period expresses a striking continuity in the devaluation of African American life in the U.S., even as official conceptualizations of black infant mortality have undergone radical shifts: from ""proof"" of African American degeneracy in the late 19th century to persistent diagnoses of black maternal pathology to today's research on the epigenetic impacts of racism via lifelong stress on the maternal body. I frame these conceptualizations, and their associated interventions, as successive paradigms of what Michel Foucault called ""biopolitics,"" or attempts to optimize populations' collective life in ways that entail racially exclusionary elements. I use a wide variety of sources, including Foucault, Orlando Patterson, ""Afro-pessimist"" scholars like Saidiya Hartman, Jared Sexton, and Frank Wilderson III, Michel De Certeau, Bruno Latour, W.E.B. Du Bois, Audre Lorde, racist statistician Frederick Hoffman, and accounts of antebellum mourning practices and Jim Crow-era and contemporary African American midwives to describe and analyze a succession of biopolitical paradigms of black infant mortality, focusing in particular on the period from 1890 to 1940. I show both the repressive logics and practices of these biopolitical paradigms and some of the ways that African American political thinkers and actors have resisted and reworked these logics and practices. Highlighting the interconnections of political thought and public health research and policy, I argue that the antebellum political ontology of race issued in the enduring figuration of ""true babyhood"" as white, excluding black infants from later, formalized biopolitical concern; that Du Bois leveled a two-pronged rhetorical challenge to the prevailing turn-of-the-century biopolitical exclusion; and that the care practices of Jim Crow-era and contemporary African American midwives exemplify a potent politics of survival and affirmation of the value of black life.","|Advisor:  Di Stefano, Christine",,English,CULL|REVIEW

Jesuit education was fundamental in the development of ontological perceptions of sin and human nature, which the Jesuits imported to New France as missionaries. Once they arrived in the New World, Jesuits faced the daunting challenge of communicating inherently abstract concepts in Catholic practices such as the nature of the Trinity, Baptism, and the Eucharist across linguistic and ontological barriers, and recorded these struggles in the form of Relations that were published in Europe.

His major work, the three volume Mysterium Fidei (L921), provides an integrated account of sacrifice, one which responsively embraces the multiple and often controversial aspects of the topic of sacrifice. De la Taille rejects a supercessionist treatment of Hebrew ritual sacrifice; he incorporates a sophisticated theory of sacrifice as sign and gift; and he allows the fullness of theological tradition-scripture, the Fathers (East and West), Thomistic thought, conciliar and papal teaching, and the witness of liturgical prayer and mystical theology to inform his theory of Christian sacrifice. In surprising ways, de la Taille's magisterial work on eucharistic sacrifice forestalls the post-Vatican II liberal anxieties about sacrifice. He decidedly challenges the formidable heritage of sixteenth and seventeenth century immolation-focused eucharistic theology by providing a patristically-rich theology of sacrifice, one that stands rooted in a spirituality of prayer and ascetic practice which cannot be segregated from the ecclesial oblation of Christ's sacrifice. With his focus on the affect and desire of the offerer of sacrifice, de la Taille anticipates the 'subjective turn' that emerged in mid-twentieth century eucharistic theology, and in a way that revitalizes the critical role of ecclesial ritual sacrifice in the transformation of that desire.","|Academic Department:  Theology|Advisor:  Baldovin, John F.",,English,KEEP|REVIEW
Dissertation,"Miglierina, Stéphane",2009,Satires sociales et pratiques théâtrales à Milan au XVIIe siècle: La dramaturgie du moindre mal de Carlo Maria Maggi,Paris,Université Paris VIII,551,PhD diss.,,,,,17th century,Education -- Colleges -- Colleges of Nobles|Education -- Colleges -- Arts -- Theater|Literature -- Drama -- Comedies|History -- Politics,Europe -- Italy -- Milan,,"Carlo Maria Maggi (1630–1699), poète et dramaturge lombard, propose, dans ses cinq comédies dialectales, une réforme de la comédie: dans une tension entre formation jésuite conservatrice et volonté de renouveau moral par la satire sociale, il établit une dramaturgie du moindre mal. Elle se fonde sur la vertu aristotélicienne de l’eutrapélie pour éviter les excès. Synonyme de la demi-mesure et du juste milieu, le moindre mal théâtral est la solution pour lutter contre le désenchantement (nécessaire) du monde. L’étude littéraire, linguistique et l’histoire des spectacles permettent de forger cette dramaturgie de la comédie droite et modeste, que lui-même n’a jamais explicitée. Maggi est envisagé sous trois angles: l’homme du siècle c'est-à-dire l’élève et l’ami des jésuites, formé à leur école de l’oralité et le poète, qui, de l’éloge pétrarquisant d’éros, passe à la célébration de l’amour divin. Cet homme du siècle expérimente les genres théâtraux, de la pastorale aux drames en musique, suivant une veine comique qui annonce ses comédies. Maggi est ensuite dramaturge: il centre sa satire sur la ville. La comédie nouvelle est urbaine: la Milan des affaires, celle du cloître et celle des salons sont autant d’occasions d’édifier son public par l’arme du plurilinguisme et de l’ironie, faisant émerger un mythe du bon peuple urbain, avec son personnage clé: Meneghino. Maggi est enfin chorège (organisateur de spectacles) et l’on comprend de l’étude des conditions de représentations au Collège des Nobles de Milan l’importance de la conjoncture dans l’écriture des comédies, les ancrant profondément dans leur époque et limitant leur fortune théâtrale dans les siècles suivants.| |In his five dialectical comedies, Lombard playwright Carlo Maria Maggi (1630–1699) proposed to reform comedy. In between his conservative Jesuitical education and his search for moral renewal through social satire, Maggi elaborated a dramaturgy of the lesser evil based on Aristotle’s eutrapely, which is to limit excess. The lesser evil, a synonym for half-measures and the happy medium, is the perfect antidote to disillusionment. Through a literary and linguistic analysis and a study of past performances of the plays, this dramaturgy of an upright and modest comedy, never theorized by Maggi himself, becomes apparent. First, Maggi is viewed as a man of his century. He is seen as both the student and friend of the Jesuits, who educated him in the oral tradition, and as the poet, who evolved from the praise of Eros in Petrarch’s style towards a celebration of God’s love. He experimented with different dramatic genres, from pastoral to melodrama, following a comic thread that would lead him to write his comedies. Maggi is also a playwright, his satire focusing on the city. This new comedy was urban: taking Milan’s business life, clergy, and sociability as themes, he was able to educate his audience, using plurilingualism and irony, thus creating the myth of the good urban people and its symbolic character, Meneghino. Finally, Maggi is a corago who is to stage plays, and only after studying the conditions of creation at Milan’s Collegio de’ Nobili, is it possible to assess the sheer importance of the historical context in the process of writing the comedies. Being deeply anchored in the late 17th century, they were to have limited success on the stage in the centuries to come.","|Academic Department:  Performing Arts|Advisor:  Descroisette, François",,French,CULL|REVIEW
Dissertation,"Miller, Mark T.",2008,Why the Passion? Bernard Lonergan on the Cross as Communication,"Chestnut Hill, MA",Boston College,,PhD diss.,,,http://hdl.handle.net/2345/2235,,20th century,Theology -- Christology|Theology -- Method -- Communication,,"Lonergan, Bernard J. F., 1904–1984","This dissertation aims at understanding Bernard Lonergan’s understanding of how the passion of Jesus Christ is salvific. Because salvation is of human persons in a community, a history, and a cosmos, the first part of the dissertation examines Lonergan’s cosmology with an emphasis on his anthropology. For Lonergan the cosmos is a dynamic, interrelated hierarchy governed by the processes of what he calls “emergent probability.” Within the universe of emergent probability, humanity is given the ability to direct world processes with critical intelligence, freedom, love, and cooperation with each other and with the larger world order. This ability is not totally undirected. Rather, it has a natural orientation, a desire or eros for ultimate goodness, truth, beauty, and love, i.e. for God. When made effective through an authentic, recurrent cycle of experience, questioning, understanding, judgment, decision, action, and cooperation, this human desire for God results in progress. However, when this cycle is damaged by bias, sin and its evil consequences distort the order of creation, both in human persons and in the larger environment. Over time, the effects of sin and bias produce cumulative, self-feeding patterns of destruction, or decline. In answer to this distortion, God gives humanity the gift of grace. Grace heals and elevates human persons. Through the self-gift of divine, unrestricted Love and the Incarnate Word, God works with human sensitivity, imagination, intelligence, affect, freedom, and community to produce religious, moral, and intellectual conversion, and to form the renewed, renewing community Lonergan calls “cosmopolis” and the body of Christ. Building on this cosmology and anthropology, the second part of the dissertation turns to the culmination of God’s solution to the problem of sin and evil in the suffering and death of Jesus of Nazareth, the Christ, on the cross at Calvary. The cross does not redeem creation by destroying its order, nor does it redeem humanity by revoking its freedom. Rather, the cross redeems the world by working with the order and freedom of creation and humanity to fulfill their natural processes and purposes. Just as from all possible world orders, God chose the order of emergent probability and human freedom, from all possible ways of redeeming that order, God chose the way of the cross. How does the cross redeem a free humanity in a world of emergent probability? For Lonergan, the best way to understand the cross is through the analogy of communication. This communication is in two parts. First, the cross is a communication, primarily, of humanity to God. Lonergan calls this part “vicarious satisfaction.” He takes the general analogy from Anselm of Canterbury’s Cur Deus Homo?. But rather than understanding satisfaction primarily in an economic context of debt (as Anselm does), Lonergan situates it in the higher context of interpersonal psychology: Sin creates a rupture in the relationships between human persons and God, among human persons, and among all parts of creation. Christ’s vicarious satisfaction flows from a non-ruptured relationship. It expresses a perfect concord of the human and the divine, through its threefold communication of (1) a perfect knowledge and love of God and humanity, (2) a perfect knowledge and sorrow for the offense that sin is, (3) and a perfect knowledge and detestation of the evil sin causes. Conceived as a communication in the context of ruptured interpersonal relationships, Lonergan’s analogical understanding of the cross as vicarious satisfaction avoids Anselm’s understanding’s tendency to be misinterpreted as “satispassion” or “substitutionary penal atonement.” The other major part to Lonergan’s analogy of the cross as communication is called the “Law of the Cross.” While vicarious satisfaction is mainly Christ’s achievement prescinding from the cooperation of human freedom in a world of emergent probability, the Law of the Cross proposes that Christ’s crucifixion is an example and an exhortation to human persons. On the cross, Jesus wisely and lovingly transforms the evil consequences of sin into a twofold communication to humanity of a perfect human and divine (1) knowledge and love for humanity and (2) knowledge and condemnation of sin and evil. This twofold communication invites a twofold human response: the repentance of sin and a love for God and all things. This love and repentance form a reconciled relationship of God and humanity. Furthermore, when reconciled with God, a human person will tend to be moved to participate in Christ’s work by willingly taking on satisfaction for one’s own sin as well as the vicarious satisfaction for others’ sins. Such participatory vicarious activity invites still other human persons to repent and reconcile with God and other persons, and furthermore to engage in their own participatory acts of satisfaction and communication. Thus, Christ’s own work and human participation in his work are objective achievements as well as moving or inspiring examples. However, while Christ’s work and our participation are moving, their movements do not operate by necessity. Nor are the appropriate human responses of repentance, love, personal satisfaction, and vicarious satisfaction in any way forced upon human persons. Consequently, the cross as communication operates in harmony with a world of emergent probability and in cooperation with human freedom. With the cross as communication, redemption is reconciliation, a reconciliation that spreads historically and communally by human participation in the divine initiative. This is God’s solution to the problem of evil, according to Lonergan. Because God wills ultimately for human persons to be united to God and to all things by love, God wills freedom, and God allows the possibility of sin and evil. But sin and evil do not please God. Out of infinite wisdom, God did not do away with evil through power, but converted evil into a communication that preserves, works with, and fulfills the order of creation and the freedom of humanity.",|Academic Department:  Theology,,English,CULL|REVIEW

In chapters on Gerard Manley Hopkins, Seamus Heaney, Thomas Hardy, William Butler Yeats, and A. R. Ammons, I argue that the twentieth century sees a crucial change in the representation of conviction, as poets look for ways to replace a pre-Romantic idiom of vision and visitation with a description of the feeling of knowing that feels more suitable for a secular context. For some poets, that older idiom becomes a rich metaphorical resource for describing the feeling of conviction. We all still speak of having had ""a revelation"" when we want to attest to the suddenness and power with which a new idea asserts itself in our consciousness; Seamus Heaney, the latest of the poets I consider, fills his poems with scenes of vision and visitation as a way of answering the same evocative impulse. But many modern poets, Heaney included, recognize an imperative to psychological realism that makes those borrowed metaphors begin to feel inadequate. Here I trace five poets' efforts to invent a more integral and flexible poetic language for the intensity of the mind in engagement with its ideas: from Gerard Manley Hopkins's desire to make the music of his poetry reflective of a subtle kinesthetics of faith, to Ammons's delicate voicing, in idiom, tempo, and cadence, of the changing intensity of his own creative absorption. I argue that having a language for the feeling of conviction -- one that feels appropriate in a secular context -- furthers these poets' efforts to represent the life of the mind more generally and to represent spiritual experience in its distinctively modern forms.",|Academic Department:  English; American Literature and Language,,English,CULL|REVIEW

It analyses the impact of wider ideological and social imperatives on the diarists’ subjective experience and reads their tendency to silence the self as a symptom of the cultural pressure to merge their private and public persona. These diaries represented a forum in which the diarists perpetually negotiated their own value within the Victorian ideology of productivity and thus not only reflect their inner world but also the cultural climate of the nineteenth century. Chapter One traces the selected diarists’ reluctance to reveal private information, as well as their tendency to foreground professional productivity, to the social pressure to efface emotions relating to the self and to only cultivate those that nurtured the community. It identifies the similarities between the compulsive self-discipline advocated in the psychological discourse of the period, particularly Alexander Bain’s The Emotions and the Will (1859), and the willingness to both live up to and actively shape the cultural codes of respectability that Elizabeth Eastlake and Henry Crabb Robinson display in their diaries. Chapter Two compares and contrasts the desire for maximal professional productivity as exhibited in George Eliot’s and George Gissing’s diaries. Both worked obstinately in order to increase their own value: whereas Eliot sought to redeem her ‘guilt of the privileged,’ Gissing desperately needed to increase his financial solvency through literary output. Chapter Three discusses the ways in which John Ruskin’s diary helped him block out unrespectable and painful private experiences through transforming his obsessive desire to appropriate and “feel” visual experience into a professional task. Chapter Four shows that Gerard Manley Hopkins—because he was acutely concerned by his cultural otherness caused by his homosexuality—not only sought refuge and validation by joining the Jesuits, but by narrowing his realm of experience to nature, merged the private and the public self into the figure of the professional, asexual, dutiful and disinterested observer.","|Academic Department:  English Literature|Advisor:  Benchimol, Alex",,English,KEEP|REVIEW

Focusing on the question of agency within the realm of everyday living, my inquiry examines the emergence of a laughing subject during the post-Korean War period and the state's efforts to discipline him through cinema in the succeeding decade. A product of the new Soviet-sponsored cultural policy of the 1950s that promoted social and political satire across the socialist world, the jester became an identity tactically adopted by various individuals, which was responsible for the proliferation of nonconformist practices in North Korea. Using Michel de Certeau's concept of the everyday as a sphere of creative inventiveness, this work describes and analyzes the small acts of ""comic disobedience"" by means of which the ordinary person has been able to outmaneuver the existing order and create a thriving underground culture of antidiscipline. Spanning a variety of media from print cartoons to live-action cinema to animation, the official response to the jester's challenge, on one hand, sought to create identifiable comic characters and, on the other, effectively demarcate between humor and satire with a view of turning a jarring cacophony of laughing voices into a harmonious chorus of collective mirth serving the state's needs. Based on Bakhtin's notion of heteroglossia, my method of analysis suggests that, despite the government's attempts to eliminate any ambiguity from newly constructed ideological texts, the ordinary individual always finds myriad ways to exercise autonomy through his unending playful subversion of official discourse. By tracing the evolution of this dynamic in the North Korean streets, movie theaters, and film studios over the course of nearly two decades, I argue that the production of formal film comedy was inextricably bound up with the state's desire to interpellate a politically loyal and socially conformist subject and should be seen as part of the larger everyday aesthetic of living that took root within the socialist world.",,,English,CULL|REVIEW

During the colonial period, Jesuits were anxious to demonstrate that their religious affiliation should not debar them from the full rights of English subjects. Possessing slaves became a means of exercising Catholic entitlement to own property. However, Jesuits proved ambivalent about their responsibilities as plantation managers and they had difficulty securing the prosperity of their estates. By the 1830's, concern developed about nativist opposition to Catholicism. Jesuits feared as slave owners, they had become fodder for anti-Catholicism. They also decided to reduce their presence in rural areas in order to urbanize their ministry to serve the growing number of immigrants in the large cities of the eastern United States.

Trata-se, é certo, duma pesquisa bibliográfica, duma releitura das fontes acerca dos Tupinambá, povo indígena que habitou a costa brasileira no século XVI, e constatar as tensões, de Hans Staden a Viveiros de Castro, entre as mais diversas e, não raro, coliden-tes, interpretações da prática canibalesca indígena. Tem-se o propósito de mostrar, ao longo deste trabalho, de que maneira a declarada guerra verbal, manifesta numa acerbada polêmica religiosa, entre o franciscano André Thevet e o protestante Jean de Léry, marcaram profundamente, até os tempos da etnologia ameríndia do último século, as partições ao meio do canibal tupinambá. De um lado, o do cosmógrafo, surgiu uma corrente interpretativa baseada na utilização da metáfora católica do canibalismo, que vai culminar, depois de seguir pelos jesuítas, no ro-mantismo de José de Alencar e nas visões psicanalíticas de Estevão Pinto. Por outro lado, seguindo pela influência do pastor calvinista, descobrir-se-á outra corrente, marcadamente anticatólica, calcada na interpretação do canibalismo tupinambá pela vingança, que vai culmi-nar, decididamente, na antropologia política de Hélène Clastres e na crítica de Viveiros de Castro ao conceito de religião. Apesar, distante de postular qualquer unidade no interior destas correntes, ressaltar-se-á figuras de transição, como Florestan Fernandes que vindica o culto an-cestral (uma razão religiosa, decerto) como explicação para o canibalis-mo tupinambá, articulando o primeiro com o que chama vindita, que não é mais que a famosa justificativa da antropofagia pela vingança. A cha-ve para que o sucesso da pesquisa, crê-se, fica no conceito de sacrifício que, mostrar-se-á, transforma-se de metáfora em categoria explicativa do canibalismo tupinambá. Contudo, com o passar dos anos, surgiram outras vias interpretativas da antropofagia indígena, duas precisamente: uma ecológica, representada por Marvin Harris, e outra negacionista, famosa, sobretudo, pelos trabalhos de William Arens. A primeira surge dum resgate dos trabalhos de Evans-Pritchard acerca do canibalismo zande; a segunda, por seu turno, num contexto de crítica e reforma de certa antropologia colonialista.||This work is a study on the successive dichotomization of the Tupinamba cannibal in five hundred years of Tupinologic literature. This is, of course, a bibliographical search, a rereading of the sources about the Tupinamba, indigenous people who inhabited the Brazilian coast in the sixteenth century, to find the tensions, of Hans Staden to Viveiros de Castro, among the most diverse and conflicting interpretations of indi-genous cannibalistic practice. It is the intention to show, throughout this work, how the verbal war declared, express in religious controversy, between the Franciscan Andre Thevet and the Protestant Jean de Lery, deeply marked, until the time of the last century Amerindian ethnology, the partitions in the middle of the Tupinamba cannibal. On one hand, of the cosmography, appears a stream of interpretation based on the use of the Catholic metaphor of cannibalism, followed by the Jesuits, which will lead in the Jose de Alencar's romanticism and Estevao Pinto's psychoanalytic views. Moreover, following the influence of Calvinist pas-tor, will find another stream, markedly anti-catholic, based on interpre-tation of cannibalism of the Tupinamba for revenge, which will lead in the political anthropology of Helene Clastres and the critical of religion of Viveiros de Castro. Although, far from postulating any unit in these streams, will be show a transitional figure like Florestan Fernandes, who vindicate the ancestral cult (a religious reason, certainly) as an explana-tion of tupinamba cannibalism, articulating it with he calls vindita, which is nothing more than then the famous reasons of revenge by anth-ropophagy. The key to the successes of this research, it is believed, is the concept of sacrifice that becomes the metaphor in explanatory cate-gory. However, over the years, there were others ways of interpreting indigenous anthropophagy: ecological, represented for Marvin Harris, and another denial, famous, represented especially for the works of William Arens. The first appears of the redemption of the Evans-Pritchard's works about zande cannibalism; the second, in a context of criticism and reform of the colonial anthropology.","|Academic Department:  Social Anthropology|Advisor:  Sáez, Oscar Calavia",,Portuguese,CULL|REVIEW

Engaging debates about Indian-White relations, borderlands, colonial identities, and the nature of empires in early America, it draws on published and archival materials from French, British, Spanish and American sources. The Creole villages of Illinois Country, from their beginnings as illegal fur trade outposts, became thriving agricultural villages with a population of 1500 by the 1750s. Yet these remote colonies had contentious relations with colonial governments that tried to control the early Mississippi Valley. At the center of this dissertation are questions about community and identity on the frontier of empires. From the start, settlers went to Illinois for reasons that clashed with the agenda of the French authorities, threatening to become autonomous and separate from the imperial system. Jesuits created a mission where they spoke Illinois languages and refused to frenchify their Indian charges. Robert La Salle made in Illinois the first piece of an ""imaginary kingdom""---a new fur trade empire which promised to compete with the interests of New France. Meanwhile, fur traders went to pursue their own interests outside the restrictive regulations of New France, engaging in illegal trade, marrying Indian women, and eventually farming. By the time Louisiana authorities began to exercise authority over Illinois, immigration reshaped the colony, but the local community in Illinois preserved a reputation for autonomy and even independence. Approaching this frontier community, imperialists worried about the loyalty of the people who lived there, as colonists actively protected local interests and patterns. The result was a distinctive empire by collaboration in Illinois Country. Attempting to reconstruct the community and convert its inhabitants into loyal subjects at the end of the French regime, British and Spanish administrators arriving in Illinois in the 1760s attempted new policies of bordering and control on the Mississippi River. Meanwhile, the Creole colonists strategically negotiated the new imperial requirements as they attempted to preserve local patterns intact.",|Academic Department:  History,,English,KEEP|REVIEW

F., 1904–1984","This dissertation offers a critical response to the fundamental sacramental theology of Louis-Marie Chauvet drawing on the works of Bernard Lonergan. Chauvet has articulated a significant critique of the western theological tradition's use of metaphysics, especially in interpreting doctrines relating to the presence of Christ in the Eucharist, liturgical sacrifice, and sacramental causality. Chauvet's criticisms raise questions about what philosophical tools allow theologians to develop a fruitful analogical understanding of the mysteries communicated in the sacraments. This dissertation responds to Chauvet's challenge to theology to adopt a new foundation in the symbolic by turning to the derived, critical metaphysics of Bernard Lonergan. The dissertation argues that Lonergan's critical metaphysics can help theologians to develop fruitful understandings of doctrines relating to Eucharistic presence, liturgical sacrifice, and sacramental causality. In addition Lonergan's categories of meaning offer resources for interpreting sacramental doctrines on the level of the time, while maintaining the genuine achievements of the past.|Chapter one presents a survey of some recent Catholic Eucharistic theologies in order to provide a context for our investigation. Here we identify existentialist-phenomenological, postmodern, and neo-traditionalist approaches to Eucharistic doctrines. Chapters two, three, and four present a dialectical comparison of Chauvet and Lonergan on metaphysics as it pertains to Eucharistic theology specifically. Chapter two examines Chauvet's postmodern critique of metaphysical foundations of scholastic Eucharistic theology. Our particular concern will be with Chauvet's methods, especially whether his appropriation of the Heideggerian critique of scholastic theology offers an accurate account of Thomas Aquinas, and whether it offers a fruitful way forward in Eucharistic theology. Chapter three explores Lonergan's foundations for metaphysics in cognitional theory and epistemology. Lonergan's critical groundwork in cognitional theory attends to the problems of bias and the polymorphism of human consciousness that lead to a heuristic metaphysics rather than a tidy conceptual system. Chapter four explicates Lonergan's heuristic metaphysics and articulates the elements of metaphysics that enable an understanding of the general category of causality in critical realist metaphysics. Chapter five explores Lonergan's foundations for theological reflection paying particular attention to the importance of intellectual conversion before going on to survey Lonergan's categories of meaning. Chapter six engages the task of systematic theology and proposes an understanding of Eucharistic doctrines grounded in Lonergan's critical realist philosophy and transposed into categories of meaning.","|Academic Department:  Theology|Advisor:  Lawrence, Frederick G.",,English,CULL|REVIEW

The dissertation demonstrates that precisely because Rahner always begins with historical experience, his fundamental theology is hermeneutical: it is a ""transcendental hermeneutics"" Rahner's epistemologically nonfoundationalist ""transcendental hermeneutics"" both grounds the normative claims of Christian faith and meets the exigencies of postmodernity as exemplified by Fiorenza.","|Academic Department:  Theology|Advisor:  Johnson, Elizabeth A.",,English,KEEP|REVIEW

À ce propos, nous avons choisi de prendre en considération une partie de l’œuvre de Michel de Certeau. Cet historien jésuite, sans avoir directement interrogé les nœuds constituant la trame de notre présent historiographique, a questionné de manière radicale la pratique historiographique, poussant à la limite ses faiblesses et sa fragilité, de sorte que son œuvre ouvre un espace inédit où la réflexion historiographique s’exerce à parcourir les impasses et les contradictions du présent. Notre réflexion a croisé aussi l’historien allemand Reinhart Koselleck (qui, de sa part, a essayé de reconstruire les modalités possibles de construction de l’expérience historique) pour s’achever enfin sur la figure littéraire de Jacques Austerlitz, le protagoniste du roman homonyme de l’écrivain allemand W. G. Sebald. Suivre la marche de ce professeur constitue un moyen pour interroger de manière « oblique » l’historiographie contemporaine ; Austerlitz devient, dans le cadre de notre démarche, une image d’historien. Il s’agit d’une image d’historien vaincu, la seule image, pourtant, capable de redonner sens à la pratique historiographique, le vaincu étant une catégorie essentielle de la possibilité de l’expérience historique et de son écriture.||The aim of this thesis is to call into question contemporary historiography; to inquire on it starting from its social legitimation and its essence as a discipline, now that some practices and elements have been capable of putting its traditional function in doubt. With traditional function I mean the ability to give meaning to the past, to represent it, giving it a place outside the present, putting it out of the present without loosing it. In this regard, I have taken in consideration a part of Michel de Certeau’s work. This Jesuit historian has not reflected in a direct way on the framework of present historiography, but has radically confronted its practice, pushing its weaknesses and frailties to the limit. His work throws new light on the discipline opening a field of research in which historiographical thought tries to inhabit the impasses and the contradictions of the present. I have discussed some essays of the German historian Reinhart Koselleck (who has tried to analyse the structure and the ways of construction of historical experience) finishing my analysis of the literary figure of Austerlitz, main figure of W. G. Sebald’s homonymic novel. Following the trail of this professor we try once again to call into question present historiography in an oblique way. Austerlitz becomes in our research, a figure of the historian. It is the figure of a defeated historian, but it is the only one still capable of giving meaning to the practice of historiography. The defeated is the essential and inescapable category of the possibility of experiencing and writing history.",|Advisor:  François Hartog,,French,CULL|REVIEW

A nom de la foi chrétienne, cette resistance s'oppose non seulement au nazisme mais surtout à une entreprise directement anti-humaniste, anti-chrétienne, anti-évangélique. Refusant les jugements réducteurs et politisés des évènements du monde émanant d'une lecture idéologique limitée aux seules réalités apparentes, ce jésuite se plonge dans le discernement socio-politique, en débattant de la question de l'autorité du nazisme et du gouvernement de Vichy avec l'écrivain Alphonse de Châteaubriant et le cardinal Alfred Baudrillart (France, prends garde de perdre ton âme, 1941), et le Père Maurice Lesaunier (Mémoire au cardinal Suhard, 1942). Son discernement socio-politique se base sur les fondements philosophico-théologiques de l'Autorité, du Bien commun (Autorité et Bien commun, 1941) et de la vision chrétienne du monde (Pax nostra. Examen de conscience international, 1936). Enfin, ces fondements philosophico-théologiques ne s'éclairent que dans la clef de voûte de la spiritualité ignatienne qui est la décision de la liberté humaine face à la Liberté divine dans une rencontre amoureuse: l'Election (La dialectique des Exercices spirituels de Saint Ignace de Loyola, 1931). Ce noyau qui unit sa manière d'agir, de penser et d'être en tant qu'homme chrétien et clerc, permet de comprendre son attitude politique, comprise simplement comme ""celle qui réunit l'actuel et l'éternel"" dans le hic et nunc de l'histoire.||Within the context of the German occupation, this research aims to understand Fr. Gaston Fessard's political, intellectual and spiritual resistance to Nazism. In the name of the Christian Faith, this resistance opposes not only Nazism but moreover an entreprise that is fundamentally anti-humanist, anti-christian and anti-gospel. Avoiding simplistic and politicised judgements emanating from a limited, ideological reading of apparent realities, this Jesuit pursues a socio-political discernment in addressing the question of Nazi authority and of the Vichy Government together with the writer Alphonse de Châteaubriant, Cardinal Alfred Baudrillart (France, prends garde de perdre ton âme, 1941), and Fr. Maurice Lesaunier (Mémoire au cardinal Suhard, 1942). His socio-political discernment is based on the philosophical-theological foundations of Authority, the Common Good (Autorité et Bien commun, 1941) and the Christian vision of the world (Pax nostra. Examen de conscience international, 1936). Finally, these philosophical-theological foundations are only clear in the light of that key aspect of Ignatian spirituality in which human freedom faces Divine Freedom in a loving encounter: l'Election (La dialectique des Exercices spirituels de saint Ignace de Loyola, 1931). This kernel, which combines his way of acting, thinking and being as a man, a christian and a priest, helps our understanding of this political attitude, which may be expressed simply as ""that which re-unites the actual and the eternal"" in the here and now of history.","|Advisor:  Médevielle, Geneviève",,French,CULL|REVIEW

Initially known for the monumental debate with the Dominican Thomism of the Revue Thomiste, this group consists of some of the greatest theologians of the twentieth century. One of the more prominent of them was the French Jesuit Jean Daniélou. Not only did Daniélou set off the debate with the Dominican Thomists when he penned ""La Orientations Présentes de la Pensée Religieuse,"" but he continued to produce important documents in the areas of patristics, spirituality and ecumenism. Equally important as such monumental works as his Origène, Bible et Liturgie and Histoire des Doctrines Chrétiennes avant Nicée are his works on Christian spirituality.||One of the most important of Daniélou’s insights is his understanding of the relationship between theology and spirituality. Since the late middle ages, scholars have increasingly grown accustomed to dichotomizing theology and spirituality. However, more recently, scholars such as Mark McIntosh have made convincing arguments for the natural coherence of the formerly opposed disciplines and in turn made a case for the inclusion of ""mystical theology"" within the realm of the academy. This view certainly accords with Daniélou's understanding of the relationship between theology and spirituality and an investigation into his theology of prayer will serve to elucidate how he understands this relationship. In turn, it becomes clear that a unified vision of theology and spirituality enables the theologian to lay bare humanity's true vocation. Humanity is not a true humanity when it does not experience contemplation, adoration and worship. Therefore, I refer to this aspect of Daniélou's thought as his doxological humanism.","|Academic Department:  Religion|Advisor:  Candler, Peter M., Jr.",,English,KEEP|REVIEW

Subtle activism is defined as ""practices of spirit or consciousness intended to support collective transformation"" and is thus contrasted with spiritual practices that focus on individual transformation. An example is a globally-synchronized meditation and prayer event intended to support world peace. I argue that subtle activism is an emerging panentheistic religious or spiritual impulse that occurs most coherently in the context of an integral, participatory, and re-enchanted worldview. As a context for understanding the potential evolutionary significance of subtle activism, I present the evolution of consciousness frameworks of Teilhard de Chardin, Thomas Berry, and Richard Tarnas. Teilhard, Berry, and Tarnas share the view that our era can be understood as a critical turning point in the evolution of consciousness and that what is most called for, if we are to successfully meet the evolutionary challenge, is a radical shift in consciousness--a fundamentally new understanding of who we are and how we relate to each other, the planet, and the universe. I argue that these frameworks help to illuminate the potentially crucial role subtle activism may have to play in the collective transition we are called to make.","|Academic Department:  Philosophy|Advisor:  Kelly, Sean",,English,CULL|REVIEW

It also brought about diverse and often unforeseen reactions. In order to face the new challenge initiated by the missionaries, the natives observed, appraised and invented new ways to become part of this new order originating in the Western world without jeopardizing their own traditions which they felt were essential to their historic destiny. For them, it meant ensuring the survival of their identity, through strategic choices in the face of threatening ""modern ways"" imposed on them by the outside world and within a political and economic context that was both restrictive and oppressive. Above all, they tried to avoid a head-on collision which would have been fatal to them. Therefore they used the tool of trickery and the art of simulation in order to protect those cultural and religious areas that appeared essential to their survival.","|Academic Department:  History|Advisor:  Prudhomme, Claude",,French,CULL|REVIEW

Sua configuração atual resulta do processo de expansão colonial ibérica e das relações que se estabeleceram entre os colonizadores e os habitantes locais e, entre ambos e o ambiente com seus recursos. Constatou-se que sua singularidade é uma conseqüência dos processos históricos que são evidenciados em três períodos bem característicos: Período pré-jesuítico: caracterizado pela organização dos Guarani em pequenas comunidades, que ocupavam os lugares com solo fértil para a prática da agricultura, como as várzeas dos grandes rios, vales e lugares com matas. Mantinham uma relação ecológica com o território, retirando da terra somente o necessário à sua sobrevivência. Período jesuítico: no qual houve a ?redução? da comunidade indígena, que passou a manter uma nova forma de se relacionar com o território; implantando, ao mesmo tempo, um sistema de produção coletivo-complementar, aliado a um sistema comercial responsável por enviar, para a Europa, produtos como sebo, erva-mate, algodão, chifre e couro. Período pós-jesuítico: vai, desde a derrocada das Missões até os dias de hoje. Caracterizado pelos desajustes sociais, econômicos e ambientais, frutos das expansões agropecuárias, mineiras e industrial, baseada em um modelo que se caracterizou pelo deterioramento do meio ambiente como custo necessário ao progresso, não se mostrou viável para resolver os problemas econômicos e sociais da população regional. Esse período caracteriza-se também pela busca de soluções para os problemas regionais, através da dinamização do uso público do rico patrimônio histórico-cultural através do turismo. Surgem projetos e programas voltados para a dinamização do turismo regional, no entanto os mesmos não atingiram totalmente os objetivos a que se propuseram. O uso do método evolutivo histórico, a partir da pesquisa bibliográfica e da pesquisa de campo, com observação direta sistematizada e realização de entrevistas, proporcionou o alcance dos objetivos de: analisar a importância das Missões Jesuíticas na consolidação das fronteiras do sul do Brasil; analisar a situação dos sítios arqueológicos das antigas reduções jesuítico-Guarani, avaliar a importância dos remanescentes arquitetônicos das reduções como potencial turístico; analisar os programas e projetos propostos para a Região das Missões em relação ao turismo, além de fornecer subsídios que possam contribuir para a implementação, intensificação e expansão da atividade turística regional.||The present work is a descriptive explanation of the processes of the occupation of the Jesuit-Guarani Missions, which ended up transforming it into a tourist atiraction beyond borders. Its present-day status is a result of the relations which have been established between the Iberian sett and the Local inhabitants and among themselves, and the environment with its resources. It can be said that its singularity is a consequence of the history´s processes which are evident in three welI-defined periods: Pre-Jesuit period it is characterized by the organization of the Guarani Indians in small communities which occupied places having a fertile soil, good for agriculture, like the flat lands along rivers, valleys and woodland. They maintained an ecological relation with lhe territory, extracting from the soil only the every day necessities for their survival. Jesuit Period: in which there was a ""reduction"" of the Indian community and which started a new way of interaction with the territory, irnplementing, at the same time, a coilective cornplementary production system together with a business-like system responsible for sending to Europe products like tallow, mate, cotton, horn and leather. Post-Jesuit Period: beginn ing since the destruction of the Missions till nowadays. lt is characterized by social , economical and environmental due to agronornic , mineral and industrial expansion, based on a model which is characterized by the deterioration of the environment as a by-product of progress, not being able to solve the economic and social problems of the regional population. This period is also characterized because of a search for solutions for regional problems, through a dynarnic use of its rich cultural-historical touristic patrirnony. The use of lhe historical evolutionary rnethod, through bibliographic and field research, with direct and systematic observation and interviews Ied to the following objectives: to analyze the irnportance of lhe Jesuit Missions in the consolidation of the Southern Brazilian boundaries; to analyze the situation of the archeological sites of the former Jesuit-Guarani reductions, to evaluate the importance of lhe architectonic remainings of the old Jesuit-Guarani reductions as a touristic potential; tlo analyze the prograrns and the projects destined to the Missions Region as far as tourism is concerned, besides best subsidies which can contribute in the implementation, intensification and expansion of lhe regional tourism activity.","|Academic Department:  Human Geography|Advisor:  Scarlato, Francisco Capuano",,Portuguese,CULL|REVIEW

Die Weltreligionen bemühen sich im Zusammenhang von unterschiedlichen soziokulturellen Realitäten um eine bedeutungsvolle Antwort auf die menschliche Frage nach Gott. In der ganzen religiösen Geschichte der Menschheit waren und sind sich die Menschen der verborgenen Kraft des Göttlichen bewusst, welche die Menschheitsgeschichte beinflusst. Die Gläubigen der verschiedenen Religionen sind gemeinsam auf der Suche nach eben diesem Göttlichen. Die Weltreligionen sind verschiedenartig, sie reflektieren seit vielen Generationen das Streben der Menschen nach Gott, den Wunsch nach einer Beziehung mit Gott. Die Religionen, die im Kontext der unterschiedlichen soziokulturellen Wirklichkeiten existierten, haben sich bemüht, sinnvolle Antworten auf die Sehnsucht der Menschheit nach Gott zu artikulieren. Die christliche Theologie der Religionen fragt nach der theologischen Bedeutung des religiösen Pluralismus und versucht die universale religiöse Erfahrung der Menschheit im Licht des christlichen Glaubens zu interpretieren. Sie fragt: Wie können Christen im Kontext und angesichts anderer Religionen ihren eigenen Glauben neu verstehen, bekennen und leben, wie können sie aus ihrem Glauben heraus die anderen Religionen verstehen und ihnen angemessen begegnen? Wie ist die religiöse Vielfalt theologisch zu deuten? Ist die Pluralität der Religionen nur ein lästiges, zu überwindendes Übel, oder etwas positiv zu Würdigendes, das möglicherweise seinen Platz in dem einen großen Heilsplan Gottes für die Menschheit hat? Hat Gott möglicherweise mit der Vielfalt der Religionen, die nicht zu verschwinden scheint, etwas vor? Und was würde dies für das Selbstverständnis der Christen, der Kirche, für ihren Verkündigungs- und Missionsauftrag bedeuten? Ferner soll die christliche Theologie der Religionen mit der Tatsache vertraut machen, dass eine bleibende Vielfalt der Religionen existiert und andere Religionen ihrerseits universale Wahrheitsansprüche erheben. Dieser Gegebenheit muss sich die Theologie stellen und sie in einem Ansatz christlicher Religionstheologie berücksichtigen.||Dupuis considers that God alone is absolute and not the religions. God, who shows no partiality, reveals himself to all his creatures, transcending the boundaries set by human concepts, categories and structures. He appreciates the richness and variety of the gifts poured out on the humankind in a Trinitarian rhythm, in and through the various religious traditions that have helped people to seek God and find him. Hence he asks, ""Is not God perhaps greater than our hearts"" (1Jn 3:20) ""and his plan of salvation larger than our theological ideas?"" The universal plan of God for the salvation of all humankind is the one and the same for all humankind. Hence, God has envisioned religious pluralism in his sole design for the salvation of all humankind. Jesus Christ is the unique universal mediator in God's economy of salvation. Salvation occurs in the universal presence and operation of the Holy Spirit without being confused or separated from the salvific mediation of Christ. The Church, being the universal sacrament and the fullness of God's gift of salvation, the whole economy of salvation is oriented and ordained to it. While the Reign of God is the manifestation and the realization of God's plan of salvation in all its fullness, the Church is the universal sacrament of God's gift of salvation for all humankind; and so it is at the service of the Reign of God. The religious others, along with their religions, find their unity in the Reign of God. Their religions, thus, participate in the unique mediation of Christ, by the universal presence operation of the Spirit in them. The Spirit works in them toward the actualisation of the plan of salvation and helps them for their convergence in the Reign of God. The eschatological fullness of the Reign of God is the common final achievement of Christianity and the other religions.",,,English,CULL|REVIEW

Comprised of multiple, superimposed, and perforated shells, concealed windows, and light chambers, these domes display an illusionistic and scenographic quality suggestive of contemporary ephemeral and scenographic decorations. This dissertation examines Vittone's openwork domes and interprets them as a type of sacred theater, a theatrum sacrum perpetuum, in which the shells and concealed windows are understood to function like the wings and hidden lamps of a stage set. In conceiving the openwork dome as sacred theater Vittone integrated various strands of Italian Baroque architecture—the conventional and the unorthodox, the academic and the bizarre—to achieve a synthesis of the highest order. Chapter One discusses Vittone's taste for illusionism as it was formed during his architectural apprenticeship in Piedmont and his years of study at the Accademia di San Luca in Rome, where he copied drawings of ephemeral decorations and scenographic caprices by Carlo Fontana, Johann Bernhard Fisher von Erlach, Filippo Juvarra, Andrea Pozzo, and other masters. Chapter Two examines the prominence given by Vittone in his architectural theory to considerations of illumination and illusionism in which, above all, the 'voluptuous genius' of the eye is to be delighted and satisfied. Chapter Three investigates Vittone's designs for ephemeral and scenographic decorations, including catafalques, fireworks machines, and temporary apparati for the sacred theater of the Quarantfiore Devotion, and their translation into permanent architecture. Chapter Four examines Vittone's designs for openwork domes and pendentives, those with interlaced ribs and those with perforated shells, relating them to designs by Guarino Guarini and Guarini's followers in Piedmont, including Gian Giacomo Plantery, Filippo Giovanni Battista Nicolis di Robilant, Giuseppe Gerolamo Buniva, and Mario Ludovico Quarini, as well as to designs by Fontana, Fischer von Erlach, Juvarra, and other academicians. Chapter Five relates Vittone's openwork domes to quadratura painting, itself a form of sacred theater that relies on perspectival foreshortening and other optical devices. It considers also the Neo-Platonic and hermetic strains of Vittone's architectural thought and the debt it owed to the ideas of Emanuele Tesauro, Paolo Segneri, Daniello Bartoli, and other Jesuits, as well as to the hagiographies and writings of various medieval saints, including St. Bernard of Clairvaux and St. Clare of Assisi.",|Academic Department:  Architecture,,English,KEEP|REVIEW

This paper examines two instances of Jesuit missionary translation work in seventeenth-century China: Matteo Ricci's ""Tianzhu shiyi"" (The True Meaning of the Lord of Heaven) (1603), a work written in Chinese for a Chinese audience, and the ""Confucius Sinarum Philosophus"" (1687), earliest published translation of three of the Confucian Four Books into Latin for a European audience. These two important works situate the missionaries between cultures—not as passive intermediaries, but as creators of a Christian-Confucian hybridity. More than locating points of equivalency of meaning, the Jesuit translators emphasized certain aspects of an older form of Confucianism that they saw as compatible with Christianity, and they reinterpreted both belief systems in ways that would appeal to each audience while avoiding the criticism of their European superiors as well as Chinese officials and supporters. By examining not only the effects of both source and target cultures on the creation of the ""Tianzhu shiyi"" and ""Confucius Sinarum Philosophus,"" but also the influence of the two texts on their respective audiences, this project argues for a broader understanding of what constitutes translation and sheds light on this unique historical encounter between European Jesuits and Chinese elites.","|Advisor:  Sieber, Barbara A.|Reff, Daniel T.",,English,KEEP|REVIEW

F., 1904–1984","Purpose of the thesis. In this thesis, I investigate the relationship of ethics and economics. I situate this inquiry in the context of conversations in Canadian Catholic social ethics. Further, I illustrate this relationship by focussing on the function of profit in an economy. I am addressing ethics and economics out of my own concern about the systemic social and economic problems that so many people face, nationally and internationally, and that have damaged the natural systems of the planet. The Roman Catholic tradition has a long history of social teaching that has spoken out against economic situations that have degraded human dignity and freedom. In the Canadian context, there is also a significant tradition in the official church, among theologians, and in community-based organizations to respond to economic injustice. In this thesis, I use representatives from these three areas of Canadian Catholic social ethics to situate the conversation on the relationship of ethics and economics, and to show its contributions and its limits.|Summary and method. This thesis is situated in the context of Canadian Catholic social ethics. My reason for choosing this conversation to investigate the relationship of ethics and economics is my own identity as a Canadian Catholic woman with a long-standing commitment to social justice. I have chosen to illustrate this discussion by focussing on the function of profit in an economy, as profit has become a symbol in the conflicts about economic justice, symbolizing success to some and greed to others. The conversation partners that I have chosen reflect three significant areas of Canadian Catholic social ethics: the Canadian Catholic bishops represent the ""official"" church; Gregory Baum represents the voice of critical theology and critical theory; and Moses Coady and the Antigonish Movement represent the concrete community-based social economic approach. I identify the key contributions of these three conversation partners, noting that they offer a strong grounding in the principles of the Catholic social tradition. They share a deep commitment to challenging an economic situation that threatens the dignity and freedom of people. They all point to the importance of the social economy in its community-based, democratic approach to empowering those who suffer economic injustice. A key limit to all three approaches, however, is the lack of a macroeconomic analysis that could provide an alternative to mainstream analyses and could ground ethical imperatives in its very dynamics.|In addressing this limit, I turn to the work of Bernard Lonergan. Lonergan offers a macroeconomic analysis that is quite unique in that it challenges the limited single-circuit analyses that ground mainstream economics. Lonergan follows the insights of economists like Joseph Schumpeter and develops a two-circuit analysis, one that distinguishes two distinct circuits of productive activity and circulations of payments. With this distinction, Lonergan sets out the activities, relationships, and dynamic rhythms of an economic order. This analysis accounts for the elements of production and payments, their dynamic flows and fluctuations, and their effects on each other. In light of these relationships, Lonergan's macroeconomic analysis allows for an understanding of the function of profit as a social dividend.|Lonergan's macroeconomic analysis is situated in the broader context of his work on the structure of ethics. For Lonergan, there are different meanings of the good that can be distinguished in accordance with increasingly broad horizons of concern: particular goods, goods of order, and value. Economic orders are goods of order that regularly provide particular goods to everyone. As goods of order, they are structures of collaboration and intelligence whose dynamism transcends the narrow limits of self-interest. Goods of order are situated in the broader context of progress, decline, and redemption in history. In this broader context, values function to evaluate whether or not goods of order are performing their tasks of serving the well-being of everyone. While the broader horizon of values can offer challenges and guiding principles to the economic goods of order, they still require the analytical tools to understand how economies can achieve this goal.|As the ultimate goal of solving economic problems, Lonergan's methodology of functional specialization is identified as providing a strategy for interdisciplinary collaboration that sets out the relationships of theological doctrinal directives and systematic analytical response. The eight-fold methodology of functional specialization provides a cycle of discovery and response that strategically raises the foundational question of conversions and self-transcendence in searching for solutions to problems of history. In this way, the question of God's loving presence in history becomes part of the cycle of discovery and response. This ultimately places the solution of economic problems in the context of progress, decline, and redemption in history with a broad methodological strategic response.",,,English,CULL|REVIEW

Starting with the China Illustrata of Athanasius Kircher, the first chapter proceeds to archaeo-historically excavate Kircher's language-theoretical sources and influences ultimately reaching all the way back to the intellectual-historical origins of ideography in the texts of Aristotle and Plato. The second chapter examines traditional Chinese discussions of language (including the origin and function of writing), focusing on two ancient dictionaries: the Erya and the Shuowen jiezi . This chapter explains just how different pre-modern Chinese language theory is from Western ideographic speculation including the stark contrast between the Erya and such works as Peter Mark Roget's eponymous Thesaurus of English Words and Phrases . The vast difference between the two, simply stated, is that traditional Chinese theory requires quotidian human intent and concrete socio-historical embeddedness for linguistic meaning to function, whereas traditional Western theory requires reified, universal, transhistorical, perhaps even extraterrestrial Forms ( eide, ideai )--what Derrida and others have called the ""transcendental signifieds."" The third chapter carries these language-theoretical issues to an examination of the work of the scribe Sima Qian (145–87 B.C.E.), who laid the cornerstone of author-theory in China. Forcibly castrated by the emperor for a crime he did not commit, consumed by humiliation and rage, Sima Qian proceeded to compile the monumental 130 chapter Records of the Scribe , one of the most sophisticated and politically provocative documents in the history Chinese letters a text that ended up serving as the model for all subsequent historiography as well as biographical and autobiographical writing, prose fiction, and even much literary theory and criticism. The larger implication of the dissertation is that a better understanding of the differences in how the Chinese and Western traditions have discussed language, particularly how linguistic meaning functions, may well help to lead contemporary (posthumanist) theory to a more nuanced and culturally inclusive view of authorial intention.","|Academic Department:  Linguistics|Advisor:  Knechtges, David R.",,English,CULL|REVIEW

Dissertation,"Orlando, Joseph Alexander",2007,Impact of a Brief International Immersion Experience on Faculty and Staff Development for Jesuit University Mission,Seattle,Seattle University,"ix, 247",EdD diss.,,http://worldcat.org/oclc/695402502,,,21st century,Education -- Universities -- Identity|Education -- Universities -- Personnel -- Spirituality -- Social Justice|Education -- Universities -- Personnel -- Programs -- International Immersion Experiences,North America -- USA -- Washington -- Seattle|North America -- Nicaragua,,"This dissertation examined the impact of a brief international immersion experience in Nicaragua on selected faculty and staff participants from Seattle University, with regard to their development for Jesuit university mission. Jesuit universities in the United States are seeking to provide professional development opportunities for faculty and staff members that will effectively communicate the Jesuit Catholic educational mission, and that will cultivate new institutional leaders able to advance the university mission in the classroom and in the full range of university programs and activities. While it is a significant challenge to pass on the Jesuit spiritual heritage and educational tradition to a religiously and philosophically diverse population of faculty and staff members, it is a priority at a time of declining numbers of Jesuit faculty and staff members at Jesuit universities. This qualitative pilot case study sought to understand how the Nicaragua Immersion Experience at Seattle University had an impact on faculty and staff participant understanding of the Jesuit educational mission, particularly the elements of education for justice and education for global engagement. The study examined the program components which had an influence on participants and considered the expression of impact through participant attitudes and behaviors. Individual interviews were held with a purposeful sample of 15 past participants, ten faculty members and five administrators, among whom were 8 men and 7 women, selected from a pool of 80 past participants currently employed at Seattle University in June, 2007. Interviewees represented all seven program years, and reflected a wide range of disciplines, program areas and years of university service. The findings showed an impact for faculty and staff participants through a deeper and more integrated understanding of the Jesuit mission. Influential program components included intimate and humanizing encounters with the poor, the collegial experience and engagement with the Jesuit university in Managua, the Universidad Centroamericana. Behavioral impact was expressed through a range of curricular, research and program activities. Attitudinal impact was expressed through greater appreciation of university commitment to mission, deepening of faith experience for some participants, and through a range of emotions prompting new perspectives on previously held ideas.",|Academic Department:  Education,,English,KEEP|REVIEW
Dissertation,"Osheim, Amanda C.",2010,The Bishop's Discernment of the Sensus Fidelium: Insights from the Jesuit Tradition,"Chestnut Hill, MA",Boston College,,PhD diss.,,http://worldcat.org/oclc/871688606,,,,Theology -- Ecclesiology -- Episcopacy -- Apostolate|Ignatius of Loyola -- Spiritual Exercises,,"Ignatius, of Loyola, Saint, c.1491–1556","This dissertation inquires into the necessity, process, and structure of the bishop's discernment of the local church's sensus fidelium. As an authentic source of saving knowledge of God such that its reception brings union with God and others, the sensus fidelium ought to be a source for episcopal teaching. In his reception of the sensus fidelium, the bishop continues to learn and to be transformed by the apostolic faith, and is in turn better able to teach the faith with authority. If the bishop's reception of the sensus fidelium is integral to his ability to teach the apostolic faith in an authoritative manner, then the orthopraxis of that reception is of great importance. One aspect of that orthopraxis is the bishop's discernment of the sensus fidelium. As a ministerial habitus, discernment has implications both for the bishop's personal transformation and for his ability to place his spirituality at the service of the apostolate. The Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola and the structures of the Society of Jesus are employed as a comparative model of discernment. The Spiritual Exercises offers a way of viewing discernment as a virtue that develops one's capacity for both reception from and union with God and others. Discernment in the Society of Jesus is undertaken to foster unity of understanding and purpose at the service of the Society's apostolate. Structures promoting discernment and relating spirituality to authority provide insights into how discernment may be developed within the larger church.","|Academic Department:  Theology|Advisor:  Himes, Michael",,English,KEEP|REVIEW

Dissertation,"Ostrowski, Brian Eugene",2006,"The Nôm Works of Geronimo Maiorica, S.J. (1589–1656) and Their Christology","Ithaca, NY",Cornell University,"xv, 256",PhD diss.,,http://worldcat.org/oclc/82147001,,,17th century,Foreign Missions -- Biography|Foreign Missions -- Inculturation|Foreign Missions -- Theology,Asia -- Vietnam,"Majorica, Girolamo, 1589–1656","Scholarship to date on early Vietnamese Christianity has chiefly treated the comings and goings of missionaries, the numeric growth of the Christian population over time, and church-state relations. By contrast, the theology of early Vietnamese Christianity has received little attention. The question of theological content is important since understanding it is critical to forming a view of what, exactly, early Vietnamese Christians believed and how those beliefs relate both to pre-Christian belief systems in Vietnam as well as Roman Catholic orthodoxy as it was construed at the time of Christianity's implantation in seventeenth-century Vietnam. This dissertation examines twelve of the earliest Vietnamese Christian liturgical and doctrinal texts in order to reconstruct the early Vietnamese Church's understanding of Christianity's central figure. Jesus of Nazareth. These texts, written in the classical Vietnamese Nôm script, are predominantly attributed to the Jesuit missionary Geronimo Maiorica (1589–1656). The discussion of the Maiorica texts' Christology in Chapter Four is preceded by treatment of three topics which serve to contextualize the subject. First, a brief biography of Geronimo Maiorica is offered. Second, Maiorica's Nôm works are identified. The date and authorship of the texts used in this dissertation is substantiated through the analysis of missionary records, documented archival studies, obvious in-text attributions of authorship and date, theological lexicon, and time-specific peculiarities in methods of forming Nôm characters. Third, the methods by which the Maiorica texts were composed and subsequently transmitted to the present by a process of hand-copying is analyzed. This study shows that while the Christ of the Maiorica texts is recognizably similar to the Christ of contemporary Jesuit teachings in Europe, several notable modifications to seventeenth-century Jesuit Christology were made for the sake of the Vietnamese audience. First, the Jewish prophetic tradition was consistently undervalued, with the result that Jesus, though still a savior of mankind, is no longer depicted as the fulfillment of Old Testament prophesy. Second, the physical and social environment in which Jesus lived and worked takes on Vietnamese characteristics. Third, the texts embellish their account of Jesus with attributes of authority and power thought congenial to the Vietnamese audience.",,,English,KEEP|REVIEW
